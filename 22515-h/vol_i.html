<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Scotland has probably produced a more patriotic and
more extended minstrelsy than any other country in the
world. Those Caledonian harp-strains, styled by Sir
Walter Scott "gems of our own mountains," have frequently
been gathered into caskets of national song,
but have never been stored in any complete cabinet;
while no attempt has been made, at least on an ample
scale, to adapt, by means of suitable metrical translations,
the minstrelsy of the Ga&euml;l for Lowland melody.
The present work has been undertaken with the view of
supplying these deficiencies, and with the further design
of extending the fame of those cultivators of Scottish
song&mdash;hitherto partially obscured by untoward
circumstances, or on account of their own diffidence&mdash;and
of affording a stimulus towards the future cultivation
of national poetry.</p>

<p>The plan of the work is distinct from that of every
previous collection of Scottish song&mdash;the more esteemed
lyrical compositions of the various bards being printed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
along with the memoirs of the respective authors, while
the names of the poets have been arranged in chronological
order. Those have been considered as <i>modern</i>
whose lives extend into the past half-century; and the
whole of these have consequently been included in the
work. Several Highland bards who died a short
period before the commencement of the century have,
however, been introduced. Of all the Scottish poets,
whether lyrical or otherwise, who survived the period
indicated, biographical sketches will be supplied in the
course of the publication, together with memoirs of the
principal modern collectors, composers and vocalists.
The memoirs, so far as is practicable, will be prepared
from original materials, of which the Editor, after a
very extensive correspondence, has obtained a supply
more ample and more interesting than, he flatters himself,
has ever been attained by any collector of northern
minstrelsy. The work will extend to six volumes,
each of the subsequent volumes being accompanied by
a dissertation on a distinct department of Scottish
poetry and song. Each volume will be illustrated with
two elegant engravings. In the course of the work,
many original compositions will be presented, recovered
from the MSS. of the deceased poets, or contributed by
distinguished living bards.</p>

<p>For the department of the "Modern Gaelic Minstrelsy,"
the Editor has obtained the assistance of a
learned friend, intimately familiar with the language
and poetry of the Highlands. To this esteemed co-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>adjutor
the reader is indebted for the revisal of the
Gaelic department of this work, as well as for the
following prefatory observations on the subject:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Among the intelligent natives of the Highlands, it is well
known that the Gaelic language contains a quantity of poetry,
which, how difficult soever to transfuse into other tongues and
idioms, never fails to touch the heart, and excite enthusiastic
feelings. The plan of 'The Modern Scottish Minstrel' restricts
us to a period less favourable to the inspirations of the Celtic
muse than remoter times. If it is asked, What could be gained
by recurring to a more distant period? or what this unlettered
people have really to shew for their bardic pretensions? we
answer, that there is extant a large and genuine collection of
Highland minstrelsy, ranging over a long exciting period, from
the days of Harlaw to the expedition of Charles Edward. The
'Prosnachadh Catha,' or battle-song, that led on the raid of
Donald the Islander on the Garioch, is still sung; the 'Woes of
the Children of the Mist' are yet rehearsed in the ears of their
children in the most plaintive measures. Innerlochy and Killiecrankie
have their appropriate melodies; Glencoe has its dirge;
both the exiled Jameses have their p&aelig;an and their lament; Charles
Edward his welcome and his wail;&mdash;all in strains so varied, and
with imagery so copious, that their repetition is continually called
for, and their interest untiring.</p>

<p>"All that we have to offer belongs to recent times; but we
cannot aver that the merit of the verses is inferior. The interest
of the subjects is certainly immeasurably less; but, perhaps, not
less propitious to the lilts and the luinneags, in which, as in her
music and imitative dancing, the Highland border has found her
best Lowland acceptation.</p>

<p>"We are not aware that we need except any piece, out of the
more ancient class, that seems not to admit of being rivalled by
some of the compositions of Duncan Ban (Macintyre), Rob Donn,
and a few others that come into our own series, if we exclude the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
pathetic 'Old Bard's Wish,' 'The Song of the Owl,' and, perhaps,
Ian Lom's 'Innerlochy.'</p>

<p>"But, while this may be so far satisfactory to our readers, we
are under the necessity of claiming their charitable forbearance
for the strangers of the mountain whom we are to introduce to
their acquaintance. The language, and, in some respects, the
imagery and versification, are as foreign to the usages of the
Anglo-Saxon as so many samples of Orientalism. The transfusion
of the Greek and Latin choral metres is a light effort to the
difficulty of imitating the rhythm, or representing the peculiar
vein of these song-enamoured mountaineers. Those who know
how a favourite ode of Horace, or a lay of Catullus, is made to
look, except in mere paraphrase, must not talk of the poorness
or triteness of the Highlander's verses, till they are enabled to do
them justice by a knowledge of the language. We disdain any
attempt to make those bards sing in the mere English taste, even
if we could so translate them as to make them speak or sing
better than they do. The fear of his sarcasms prevented Dr
Johnson from hearing one literal version during his whole
sojourn in the Highlands. Sir Walter Scott wished that somebody
might have the manliness to recover Highland poetry
from the mystification of paraphrase or imposture, and to present
it genuine to the English reader. In that spirit we promise to
execute our task; and we shall rejoice if even a very moderate
degree of success should attend our endeavours to obtain for the
sister muse some share of that popularity to which we believe
her entitled."</p></div>

<p>In respect of the present volume of "The Modern
Scottish Minstrel," the Editor has to congratulate himself
on his being enabled to present, for the first time in
a popular form, the more esteemed lays of Carolina,
Baroness Nairn, author of "The Laird o' Cockpen,"
"The Land o' the Leal," and a greater number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
popular lyrics than any other Caledonian bard, Burns
alone excepted. Several pieces of this accomplished
lady, not previously published, have been introduced,
through the kindness of her surviving friends. The
memoir of the Baroness has been prepared from original
documents entrusted to the Editor. For permission to
engrave "The Auld House o' Gask," Lady Nairn's
birth-place, the Editor's thanks are due to Mr Paterson,
music-seller in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>While the present volume of "The Modern Scottish
Minstrel" is offered to the public with becoming diffidence,
the Editor is not without a faint ray of hope that,
if health and sufficient leisure are afforded him, the
present publication may be found the most ample and
satisfactory repository of national song which has at any
period been offered to the public.</p>

<h2>THE<br />
MODERN SCOTTISH MINSTREL</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="JOHN_SKINNER" id="JOHN_SKINNER"></a>JOHN SKINNER.</h2>


<p>Among those modern Scottish poets whose lives, by extending
to a considerably distant period, render them
connecting links between the old and recent minstrelsy
of Caledonia, the first place is due to the Rev. <span class="smcap">John
Skinner</span>. This ingenious and learned person was
born on the 3d of October 1721, at Balfour, in the
parish of Birse, and county of Aberdeen. His father,
who bore the same Christian name, was parochial schoolmaster;
but two years after his son's birth, he was presented
to the more lucrative situation of schoolmaster of
Echt, a parish about twelve miles distant from Aberdeen.
He discharged the duties of this latter appointment
during the long incumbency of fifty years. He
was twice married. By his first union with Mrs Jean
Gillanders, the relict of Donald Farquharson of Balfour,
was born an only child, the subject of this memoir. The
mother dying when the child was only two years old,
the charge of his early training depended solely on his
father, who for several years remained a widower. The
paternal duties were adequately performed: the son,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
while a mere youth, was initiated in classical learning,
and in his thirteenth year he became a successful competitor
for a bursary or exhibition in Marischal College,
Aberdeen. At the University, during the usual philosophical
course of four years, he pursued his studies with
diligence and success; and he afterwards became an
usher in the parish schools of Kemnay and Monymusk.</p>

<p>From early youth, young Skinner had courted the
Muse of his country, and composed verses in the Scottish
dialect. When a mere stripling, he could repeat,
which he did with enthusiasm, the long poem by James
I. of "Christ-kirk on the Green;" he afterwards translated
it into Latin verse; and an imitation of the same
poem, entitled "The Monymusk Christmas Ba'ing,"
descriptive of the diversions attendant on the annual
Christmas gatherings for playing the game of foot-ball
at Monymusk, which he composed in his sixteenth year,
attracting the notice of the lady of Sir Archibald Grant,
Bart. of Monymusk, brought him the favour of that influential
family. Though the humble usher of a parish
school, he was honoured with the patronage of the worthy
baronet and his lady, became an inmate of their mansion,
and had the uncontrolled use of its library. The residence
of the poet in Monymusk House indirectly conduced
towards his forming those ecclesiastical sentiments
which exercised such an important influence on his subsequent
career. The Episcopal clergyman of the district
was frequently a guest at the table of Sir Archibald;
and by the arguments and persuasive conversation of
this person, Mr Skinner was induced to enlist his sympathies
in the cause of the Episcopal or non-juring clergy
of Scotland. They bore the latter appellation from their
refusal, during the existence of the exiled family of Stewart,
to take the oath of allegiance to the House of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Hanover. In 1740, on the invitation of Mr Robert
Forbes, Episcopal minister at Leith, afterwards a bishop,
Mr Skinner, in the capacity of private tutor to the only
son of Mr Sinclair of Scolloway, proceeded to Zetland,
where he acquired the intimate friendship of the Rev.
Mr Hunter, the only non-juring clergyman in that remote
district. There he remained only one year, owing
to the death of the elder Mr Sinclair, and the removal
of his pupil to pursue his studies in a less retired locality.
He lamented the father's death in Latin, as well as in
English verse. He left Scolloway with the best wishes
of the family; and as a substantial proof of the goodwill
of his friend Mr Hunter, he received in marriage the
hand of his eldest daughter.</p>

<p>Returning to Aberdeenshire, he was ordained a presbyter
of the Episcopal Church, by Bishop Dunbar of
Peterhead; and in November 1742, on the unanimous
invitation of the people, he was appointed to the pastoral
charge of the congregation at Longside. Uninfluenced
by the soarings of ambition, he seems to have
fixed here, at the outset, a permanent habitation: he
rented a cottage at Linshart in the vicinity, which,
though consisting only of a single apartment, besides
the kitchen, sufficed for the expenditure of his limited
emoluments. In every respect he realised Goldsmith's
description of the village pastor:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A man he was to all the country dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And passing rich with forty pounds a-year;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remote from towns he ran his godly race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor e'er had changed, nor wish'd to change his place."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Secluded, however, as were Mr Skinner's habits, and
though he never had interfered in the political movements
of the period, he did not escape his share in those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
ruthless severities which were visited upon the non-juring
clergy subsequent to the last Rebellion. His
chapel was destroyed by the soldiers of the barbarous
Duke of Cumberland; and, on the plea of his having
transgressed the law by preaching to more than four
persons without subscribing the oath of allegiance, he
was, during six months, detained a prisoner in the jail
of Aberdeen.</p>

<p>Entering on the sacred duties of the pastoral office,
Mr Skinner appears to have checked the indulgence of
his rhyming propensities. His subsequent poetical productions,
which include the whole of his popular songs,
were written to please his friends, or gratify the members
of his family, and without the most distant view to
publication. In 1787, he writes to Burns, on the subject
of Scottish song:&mdash;"While I was young, I dabbled
a good deal in these things; but on getting the black
gown, I gave it pretty much over, till my daughters
grew up, who, being all tolerably good singers, plagued
me for words to some of their favourite tunes, and so
extorted those effusions which have made a public appearance,
beyond my expectations, and contrary to my
intentions; at the same time, I hope there is nothing
to be found in them uncharacteristic or unbecoming the
cloth, which I would always wish to see respected."
Some of Mr Skinner's best songs were composed at a
sitting, while they seldom underwent any revision after
being committed to paper. To the following incident,
his most popular song, "Tullochgorum," owed its origin.
In the course of a visit he was making to a friend in
Ellon (not Cullen, as has been stated on the authority
of Burns), a dispute arose among the guests on the subject
of Whig and Tory politics, which, becoming somewhat
too exciting for the comfort of the lady of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
house, in order to bring it promptly to a close, she requested
Mr Skinner to suggest appropriate words for
the favourite air, "The Reel of Tullochgorum." Mr
Skinner readily complied, and, before leaving the house,
produced what Burns, in a letter to the author, characterised
as "the best Scotch song ever Scotland saw."
The name of the lady who made the request to the poet
was Mrs Montgomery, and hence the allusion in the first
stanza of the ballad:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come gie 's a sang, Montgomery cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lay your disputes all aside;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What signifies 't for folks to chide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what was done before them?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let Whig and Tory all agree," &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Though claiming no distinction as a writer of verses,
Mr Skinner did not conceal his ambition to excel in
another department of literature. In 1746, in his
twenty-fifth year, he published a pamphlet, in defence
of the non-juring character of his Church, entitled
"A Preservative against Presbytery." A performance
of greater effort, published in 1757, excited some attention,
and the unqualified commendation of the learned
Bishop Sherlock. In this production, entitled "A Dissertation
on Jacob's Prophecy," which was intended as
a supplement to a treatise on the same subject by Dr
Sherlock, the author has established, by a critical examination
of the original language, that the words in
Jacob's prophecy (Gen. xlix. 10), rendered "sceptre"
and "lawgiver" in the authorised version, ought to be
translated "tribeship" and "typifier," a difference of
interpretation which obviates some difficulties respecting
the exact fulfilment of this remarkable prediction. In
a pamphlet printed in 1767, Mr Skinner again vindicated
the claims and authority of his Church; and on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
this occasion, against the alleged misrepresentations of
Mr Norman Sievewright, English clergyman at Brechin,
who had published a work unfavourable to the cause of
Scottish Episcopacy. His most important work, "An
Ecclesiastical History of Scotland, from the first appearance
of Christianity in that kingdom," was published in
the year 1788, in two octavo volumes. This publication,
which is arranged in the form of letters to a friend,
and dedicated, in elegant Latin verse, "Ad Filium et
Episcopum," (to his son, and bishop), by partaking too
rigidly of a sectarian character, did not attain any measure
of success. Mr Skinner's other prose works were
published after his death, together with a Memoir of the
author, under the editorial care of his son, Bishop Skinner
of Aberdeen. These consist of theological essays,
in the form of "Letters addressed to Candidates for
Holy Orders," "A Dissertation on the Sheckinah, or
Divine Presence with the Church or People of God,"
and "An Essay towards a literal or true radical exposition
of the Song of Songs," the whole being included
in two octavo volumes, which appeared in 1809. A
third volume was added, containing a collection of the
author's compositions in Latin verse, and his fugitive
songs and ballads in the Scottish dialect&mdash;the latter
portion of this volume being at the same time published
in a more compendious form, with the title, "Amusements
of Leisure Hours; or, Poetical Pieces, chiefly in
the Scottish dialect."</p>

<p>Though living in constant retirement at Linshart, the
reputation of the Longside pastor, both as a poet and
a man of classical taste, became widely extended, and
persons distinguished in the world of letters sought his
correspondence and friendship. With Dr Gleig, afterwards
titular Bishop of Brechin, Dr Doig of Stirling,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
and John Ramsay of Ochtertyre, he maintained an
epistolary intercourse for several years. Dr Gleig, who
edited the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>, consulted Mr Skinner
respecting various important articles contributed to
that valuable publication. His correspondence with
Doig and Ramsay was chiefly on their favourite topic
of philology. These two learned friends visited Mr
Skinner in the summer of 1795, and entertained him
for a week at Peterhead. This brief period of intellectual
intercourse was regarded by the poet as the most
entirely pleasurable of his existence; and the impression
of it on the vivid imagination of Mr Ramsay is
recorded in a Latin eulogy on his northern correspondent,
which he subsequently transmitted to him. A
poetical epistle addressed by Mr Skinner to Robert
Burns, in commendation of his talents, was characterized
by the Ayrshire Bard as "the best poetical compliment
he had ever received." It led to a regular
correspondence, which was carried on with much satisfaction
to both parties. The letters, which chiefly
relate to the preparation of Johnson's <i>Musical Museum</i>,
then in the course of publication, have been included in
his published correspondence. Burns never saw Mr
Skinner; he had not informed himself as to his locality
during the prosecution of his northern tour, and had
thus the mortification of ascertaining that he had been
in his neighbourhood, without having formed his personal
acquaintance. To Mr Skinner's son, whom he
accidentally met in Aberdeen on his return, he expressed
a deep regret for the blunder, as "he would
have gone twenty miles out of his way to visit the
author of 'Tullochgorum.'"</p>

<p>As a man of ingenuity, various acquirements, and
agreeable manners, Mr Skinner was held in much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
estimation among his contemporaries. Whatever he
read, with the assistance of a commonplace-book, he
accurately remembered, and could readily turn to account;
and, though his library was contained in a
closet of five feet square, he was abundantly well informed
on every ordinary topic of conversation. He
was fond of controversial discussion, and wielded both
argument and wit with a power alarming to every
antagonist. Though keen in debate, he was however
possessed of a most imperturbable suavity of temper.
His conversation was of a playful cast, interspersed
with anecdote, and free from every affectation of learning.
As a clergyman, Mr Skinner enjoyed the esteem
and veneration of his flock. Besides efficiently discharging
his ministerial duties, he practised gratuitously
as a physician, having qualified himself, by
acquiring a competent acquaintance with the healing
art at the medical classes in Marischal College. His
pulpit duties were widely acceptable; but his discourses,
though edifying and instructive, were more the result
of the promptitude of the preacher than the effects of a
painstaking preparation. He abandoned the aid of the
manuscript in the pulpit, on account of the untoward
occurrence of his notes being scattered by a startled fowl,
in the early part of his ministry, while he was addressing
his people from the door of his house, after the
wanton destruction of his chapel.</p>

<p>In a scene less calculated to invite poetic inspiration
no votary of the muse had ever resided. On every side
of his lonely dwelling extended a wild uncultivated plain;
nor for miles around did any other human habitation
relieve the monotony of this cheerless solitude. In her
gayest moods, Nature never wore a pleasing aspect in
<i>Long-gate</i>, nor did the distant prospect compensate for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the dreary gloominess of the surrounding landscape.
For his poetic suggestions Mr Skinner was wholly dependent
on the singular activity of his fancy; as he
derived his chief happiness in his communings with an
attached flock, and in the endearing intercourse of his
family. Of his children, who were somewhat numerous
he contrived to afford the whole, both sons and
daughters, a superior education; and he had the satisfaction,
for a long period of years, to address one of his
sons as the bishop of his diocese.</p>

<p>The death of Mr Skinner's wife, in the year 1799,
fifty-eight years after their marriage, was the most
severe trial which he seems to have experienced. In a
Latin elegy, he gave expression to the deep sense which
he entertained of his bereavement. In 1807, his son,
Bishop Skinner, having sustained a similar bereavement,
invited his aged father to share the comforts of
his house; and after ministering at Longside for the
remarkably lengthened incumbency of sixty-five years,
Mr Skinner removed to Aberdeen. But a greater
change was at hand; on the 16th of June 1807, in
less than a week after his arrival, he was suddenly
seized with illness, and almost immediately expired.
His remains were interred in the churchyard of Longside;
and the flock to which he had so long ministered
placed over the grave a handsome monument, bearing,
on a marble tablet, an elegant tribute to the remembrance
of his virtues and learning. At the residence of
Bishop Skinner, he had seen his descendants in the
fourth generation.</p>

<p>Of Mr Skinner's songs, printed in this collection, the
most popular are "Tullochgorum," "John o' Badenyon,"
and "The Ewie wi' the Crookit Horn." The
whole are pervaded by sprightliness and good-humoured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
pleasantry. Though possessing the fault of being somewhat
too lengthy, no song-compositions of any modern
writer in Scottish verse have, with the exception of
those of Burns, maintained a stronger hold of the Scottish
heart, or been more commonly sung in the social
circle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="WILLIAM_CAMERON" id="WILLIAM_CAMERON"></a>WILLIAM CAMERON.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">William Cameron</span>, minister of Kirknewton, in the
county of Edinburgh, was educated in Marischal College,
Aberdeen, where he was a pupil of Dr Beattie,
"who ever after entertained for him much esteem." A
letter, addressed to him by this eminent professor, in
1774, has been published by Sir William Forbes;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
and his name is introduced at the beginning of Dr
Beattie's "Letter to the Rev. Hugh Blair, D.D., on the
Improvement of Psalmody in Scotland. 1778, 8vo:"&mdash;"The
message you lately sent me, by my friend Mr
Cameron, has determined me to give you my thoughts
at some length upon the subject of it."</p>

<p>He died in his manse, on the 17th of November
1811, in the 60th year of his age, and the 26th year of
his ministry. He was a considerable writer of verses,
and his compositions are generally of a respectable
order. He was the author of a "Collection of Poems,"
printed at Edinburgh in 1790, in a duodecimo volume;
and in 1781, along with the celebrated John Logan
and Dr Morrison, minister of Canisbay, he contributed
towards the formation of a collection of Paraphrases
from Scripture, which, being approved of by the Ge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>neral
Assembly, are still used in public worship in
the Church of Scotland. A posthumous volume of
verses by Mr Cameron, entitled "Poems on Several
Occasions," was published by subscription in 1813&mdash;8vo,
pp. 132. The following song, which was composed
by Mr Cameron, on the restoration of the forfeited
estates by Act of Parliament, in 1784, is copied from
Johnson's "Musical Museum." It affords a very favourable

<h2><a name="MRS_JOHN_HUNTER" id="MRS_JOHN_HUNTER"></a>MRS JOHN HUNTER.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Anne Home</span> was born in the year 1742. She was the
eldest daughter of Robert Home, of Greenlaw, in Berwickshire,
surgeon of Burgoyne's Regiment of Light
Horse, and afterwards physician in Savoy. By contracting
an early marriage, in which affection overcame
more prudential considerations, both her parents gave
offence to their relations, who refused to render them
pecuniary assistance. Her father, though connected
with many families of rank, and himself the son of a
landowner, was consequently obliged to depend, in the
early part of his career, on his professional exertions for
the support of his family. His circumstances appear
subsequently to have been more favourable. In July
1771, Miss Home became the wife of John Hunter, the
distinguished anatomist, to whom she bore two children.
She afforded evidence of her early poetical talent, by
composing, before she had completed her twenty-third
year, the song beginning, "Adieu! ye streams that
smoothly glide." This appeared in the <i>Lark</i>, an
Edinburgh periodical, in the year 1765. In 1802, she
published a collection of her poems, in an octavo volume,
which she inscribed to her son, John Banks Hunter.</p>

<p>During the lifetime of her distinguished husband,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Mrs Hunter was in the habit of receiving at her table,
and sharing in the conversation of, the chief literary
persons of her time. Her evening <i>conversazioni</i> were
frequented by many of the more learned, as well as
fashionable persons in the metropolis. On the death of
her husband, which took place in 1793, she sought
greater privacy, though she still continued to reside in
London. By those who were admitted to her intimacy,
she was not more respected for her superior talents and
intelligence, than held in esteem for her unaffected simplicity
of manners. She was the life of her social
parties, sustaining the happiness of the hour by her
elegant conversation, and encouraging the diffident by
her approbation. Amiable in disposition, she was possessed
of a beautiful countenance and a handsome person.
She wrote verses with facility, but she sought no
distinction as a poet, preferring to be regarded as a good
housewife and an agreeable member of society. In her
latter years, she obtained amusement in resuming the
song-writing habits of her youth, and in corresponding
with her more intimate friends. She likewise derived
pleasure in the cultivation of music: she played with
skill, and sung with singular grace.</p>

<p>Mrs Hunter died at London, on the 7th January
1821, after a lingering illness. Several of her lyrics
had for some years appeared in the collections of national
poetry. Those selected for the present work have
long maintained a wide popularity. The songs evince
a delicacy of thought, combined with a force and sweetness
of expression.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="ALEXANDER_DUKE_OF_GORDON" id="ALEXANDER_DUKE_OF_GORDON"></a>ALEXANDER, DUKE OF GORDON.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Alexander</span>, the fourth Duke of Gordon, was born in
the year 1743, and died on the 17th of January 1827,
in the eighty-fourth year of his age. Chiefly remembered
as a kind patron of the poet Burns, his name
is likewise entitled to a place in the national minstrelsy
as the author of an excellent version of the
often-parodied song, "Cauld Kail in Aberdeen." Of
this song, the first words, written to an older tune,
appeared in the second volume of Herd's "Collection,"
in 1776. These begin&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Cauld kail in Aberdeen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And castocks in Strabogie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But yet I fear they 'll cook o'er soon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never warm the cogie."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The song is anonymous, as is the version, first published
in Dale's "Scottish Songs," beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There 's cauld kail in Aberdeen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And castocks in Strabogie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where ilka lad maun hae his lass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I maun hae my cogie."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A third version, distinct from that inserted in the text,
was composed by William Reid, a bookseller in Glasgow,
who died in 1831. His song is scarcely known.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
The Duke's song, with which Burns expressed himself
as being "charmed," was first published in the second
volume of Johnson's "Musical Museum." It is not
only gay and animating, but has the merit of being free
of blemishes in want of refinement, which affect the
others. The "Bogie" celebrated in the song, it may
be remarked, is a river in Aberdeenshire, which, rising
in the parish of Auchindoir, discharges its waters into
the Deveron, a little distance below the town of Huntly.
It gives its name to the extensive and rich valley of
Strathbogie, through which it proceeds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="MRS_GRANT_OF_CARRON" id="MRS_GRANT_OF_CARRON"></a>MRS GRANT OF CARRON.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Grant</span> of Carron, the reputed author of one song,
which has long maintained a favoured place, was a
native of Aberlour, on the banks of the Spey, in the
county of Banff. She was born about the year 1745,
and was twice married&mdash;first, to her cousin, Mr Grant of
Carron, near Elchies, on the river Spey, about the year
1763; and, secondly, to Dr Murray, a physician in
Bath. She died at Bath about the year 1814.</p>

<p>In his correspondence with George Thomson, Burns,
alluding to the song of Mrs Grant, "Roy's Wife,"
remarks that he had in his possession "the original words
of a song for the air in the handwriting of the lady who
composed it," which, he adds, "are superior to any
edition of the song which the public has seen." He
subsequently composed an additional version himself,
beginning, "Canst thou leave me thus, my Katie?"
but this, like others of the bard's conversions of Scottish
songs into an English dress, did not become popular.
The verses by his female friend, in which the lady is
made to be the sufferer by misplaced affection, and
commencing, "Stay, my Willie, yet believe me," though
published, remain likewise in obscurity. "Roy's Wife"
was originally written to an old tune called the "Ruf<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>fian's
Rant," but this melody is now known by the
name of its favourite words. The sentiment of the song
is peculiarly pleasing. The rejected lover begins by
loudly complaining of his wrongs, and the broken
assurances of his former sweetheart: then he suddenly
recalls what were her good qualities; and the recollection
of these causes him to forgive her marrying another,
and even still to extend towards her his warmest
sympathies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="ROBERT_COUPER_MD" id="ROBERT_COUPER_MD"></a>ROBERT COUPER, M.D.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Dr Couper</span> was born in the parish of Sorbie, in Wigtonshire,
on the 22d of September 1750. His father
rented the farm of Balsier in that parish. With a view
towards the ministry in the Scottish Church, he proceeded
to the University of Glasgow in 1769; but being
deprived of both his parents by death before the completion
of the ordinary period of academical study, and
his pecuniary means being limited, he quitted the country
for America, where he became tutor to a family in
Virginia. He now contemplated taking orders in the
Episcopal Church, but on the outbreak of the War of
Independence in 1776 he returned to Britain without
fulfilling this intention. He resumed his studies at
Glasgow preparatory to his seeking a surgeon's diploma;
and he afterwards established himself as a medical practitioner
in Newton-Stewart, a considerable village in his
native county. From this place he removed to Fochabers,
about the year 1788, on being recommended, by
his friend Dr Hamilton, Professor of Anatomy at Glasgow,
as physician to the Duke of Gordon. Before
entering on this new sphere of practice, he took the
degree of M.D. At Fochabers he remained till the year
1806, when he again returned to the south. He died at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Wigton on the 18th January 1818. From a MS. Life
of Dr Couper, in the possession of a gentleman in Wigton,
and communicated to Dr Murray, author of "The
Literary History of Galloway," these leading events of
Dr Couper's life were first published by Mr Laing, in
his "Additional Illustrations to the Scots Musical Museum,"
vol. iv. p. 513.</p>

<p>Dr Couper published "Poetry, chiefly in the Scottish
Language" (Inverness, 1804), 2 vols. 12mo. Among
some rubbish, and much tawdry versification, there is
occasional power, which, however, is insufficient to compensate
for the general inferiority. There are only a
few songs, but these are superior to the poems; and
those following are not unworthy of a place among the
modern national minstrelsy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="LADY_ANNE_BARNARD" id="LADY_ANNE_BARNARD"></a>LADY ANNE BARNARD.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Lady Anne Lindsay</span> was the eldest of a family of
eight sons and three daughters, born to James, Earl of
Balcarres, by his spouse, Anne Dalrymple, a daughter
of Sir Robert Dalrymple, of Castleton, Bart. She was
born at Balcarres, in Fife, on the 8th of December 1750.
Inheriting a large portion of the shrewdness long possessed
by the old family of Lindsay, and a share of
talent from her mother, who was a person of singular
energy, though somewhat capricious in temper, Lady
Anne evinced, at an early age, an uncommon amount of
sagacity. Fortunate in having her talents well directed,
and naturally inclined towards the acquisition of learning,
she soon began to devote herself to useful reading,
and even to literary composition. The highly popular
ballad of "Auld Robin Gray" was written when she
had only attained her twenty-first year. According to
her own narrative, communicated to Sir Walter Scott,
she had experienced loneliness on the marriage of her
younger sister, who accompanied her husband to London,
and had sought relief from a state of solitude by
attempting the composition of song. An old Scottish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
melody,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> sung by an eccentric female, an attendant on
Lady Balcarres, was connected with words unsuitable to
the plaintive nature of the air; and, with the design of
supplying the defect, she formed the idea of writing
"Auld Robin Gray." The hero of the ballad was the
old herdsman at Balcarres. To the members of her
own family Lady Anne only communicated her new
ballad&mdash;scrupulously concealing the fact of her authorship
from others, "perceiving the shyness it created in
those who could write nothing."</p>

<p>While still in the bloom of youth, the Earl of Balcarres
died, and the Dowager Countess having taken up
her residence in Edinburgh, Lady Anne experienced
increased means of acquainting herself with the world of
letters. At her mother's residence she met many of the
literary persons of consideration in the northern metropolis,
including such men as Lord Monboddo, David
Hume, and Henry Mackenzie. To comfort her sister,
Lady Margaret Fordyce, who was now a widow, she
subsequently removed to London, where she formed the
acquaintance of the principal personages then occupying
the literary and political arena, such as Burke, Sheridan,
Dundas, and Windham. She also became known to
the Prince of Wales, who continued to entertain for her
the highest respect. In 1793, she married Andrew
Barnard, Esq., son of the Bishop of Limerick, and
afterwards secretary, under Lord Macartney, to the
colony at the Cape of Good Hope. She accompanied
her husband to the Cape, and had meditated a voyage
to New South Wales, that she might minister, by her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
benevolent counsels, towards the reformation of the
convicts there exiled. On the death of her husband in
1807, she again resided with her widowed sister, the
Lady Margaret, till the year 1812, when, on the marriage
of her sister to Sir James Burges, she occupied a
house of her own, and continued to reside in Berkeley
Square till the period of her death, which took place on
the 6th of May 1825.</p>

<p>To entire rectitude of principle, amiability of manners,
and kindliness of heart, Anne Barnard added the
more substantial, and, in females, the more uncommon
quality of eminent devotedness to intellectual labour.
Literature had been her favourite pursuit from childhood,
and even in advanced life, when her residence
was the constant resort of her numerous relatives, she
contrived to find leisure for occasional literary <i>r&eacute;unions</i>,
while her forenoons were universally occupied in mental
improvement. She maintained a correspondence with
several of her brilliant contemporaries, and, in her more
advanced years, composed an interesting narrative of
family Memoirs. She was skilled in the use of the
pencil, and sketched scenery with effect. In conversation
she was acknowledged to excel; and her stories<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and anecdotes were a source of delight to her friends.
She was devotedly pious, and singularly benevolent:
she was liberal in sentiment, charitable to the indigent,
and sparing of the feelings of others. Every circle was
charmed by her presence; by her condescension she
inspired the diffident; and she banished dulness by the
brilliancy of her humour. Her countenance, it should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
be added, wore a pleasant and animated expression, and
her figure was modelled with the utmost elegance of
symmetry and grace. Her sister, Lady Margaret Fordyce,
was eminently beautiful.</p>

<p>The popularity obtained by the ballad of "Auld
Robin Gray" has seldom been exceeded in the history
of any other metrical composition. It was sung in every
fashionable circle, as well as by the ballad-singers, from
Land's-end to John o' Groat's; was printed in every
collection of national songs, and drew tears from our
military countrymen both in America and India. With
the exception of Pinkerton, every writer on Scottish
poetry and song has awarded it a tribute of commendation.
"The elegant and accomplished authoress," says
Ritson, "has, in this beautiful production, to all that
tenderness and simplicity for which the Scottish song
has been so much celebrated, united a delicacy of expression
which it never before attained." "'Auld Robin
Gray,'" says Sir Walter Scott, "is that real pastoral
which is worth all the dialogues which Corydon and
Phillis have had together, from the days of Theocritus
downwards."</p>

<p>During a long lifetime, till within two years of her
death, Lady Anne Barnard resisted every temptation to
declare herself the author of the popular ballad, thus
evincing her determination not to have the secret wrested
from her till she chose to divulge it. Some of those
inducements may be enumerated. The extreme popularity
of the ballad might have proved sufficient in itself
to justify the disclosure; but, apart from this consideration,
a very fine tune had been put to it by a doctor of
music;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> a romance had been founded upon it by a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
of eminence; it was made the subject of a play, of
an opera, and of a pantomime; it had been claimed by
others; a sequel had been written to it by some scribbler,
who professed to have composed the whole ballad;
it had been assigned an antiquity far beyond the author's
time; the Society of Antiquaries had made it the subject
of investigation; and the author had been advertised
for in the public prints, a reward being offered for
the discovery. Never before had such general interest
been exhibited respecting any composition in Scottish
verse.</p>

<p>In the "Pirate," published in 1823, the author of "Waverley"
had compared the condition of Minna to that of
Jeanie Gray, in the words of Lady Anne, in a sequel
which she had published to the original ballad:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nae langer she wept, her tears were a' spent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despair it was come, and she thought it content;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She thought it content, but her cheek it grew pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she droop'd like a snowdrop broke down by the hail!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At length, in her seventy-third year, and upwards of
half a century after the period of its composition, the
author voluntarily made avowal of the authorship of the
ballad and its sequel. She wrote to Sir Walter Scott,
with whom she was acquainted, requesting him to
inform his <i>personal friend</i>, the author of "Waverley,"
that she was indeed the author. She enclosed a copy to
Sir Walter, written in her own hand; and, with her
consent, in the course of the following year, he printed
"Auld Robin Gray" as a contribution to the Bannatyne
Club.</p>

<p>The second part has not acquired such decided popularity,
and it has not often been published with it in
former Collections. Of the fact of its inequality, the
accomplished author was fully aware: she wrote it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
simply to gratify the desire of her venerable mother,
who often wished to know how "the unlucky business
of Jeanie and Jamie ended." The Countess, it may be
remarked, was much gratified by the popularity of the
ballad; and though she seems, out of respect to her
daughter's feelings, to have retained the secret, she could
not resist the frequent repetition of it to her friends.</p>

<p>In the character of Lady Anne Barnard, the defective
point was a certain want of decision, which not only led
to her declining many distinguished and advantageous
offers for her hand, but tended, in some measure, to
deprive her of posthumous fame. Illustrative of the
latter fact, it has been recorded that, having entrusted to
Sir Walter Scott a volume of lyrics, composed by herself
and by others of the noble house of Lindsay, with
permission to give it to the world, she withdrew her
consent after the compositions had been printed in a
quarto volume, and were just on the eve of being published.
The copies of the work, which was entitled
"Lays of the Lindsays," appear to have been destroyed.
One lyric only has been recovered, beginning, "Why
tarries my love?" It is printed as the composition of
Lady Anne Barnard, in a note appended to the latest
edition of Johnson's "Musical Museum," by Mr C. K.
Sharpe, who transcribed it from the <i>Scots Magazine</i> for
May 1805. The popular song, "Logie o' Buchan,"
sometimes attributed to Lady Anne in the Collections,
did not proceed from her pen, but was composed
by George Halket, parochial schoolmaster of
Rathen, in Aberdeenshire, about the middle of the last
century.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

are some good stanzas, which, however, the author had
thought proper to expunge from the piece in its altered

grief of his spouse, is beautiful for its simplicity:&mdash;</p>

<h3><a name="JOHN_TAIT" id="JOHN_TAIT"></a>JOHN TAIT.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">John Tait</span> was, in early life, devoted to the composition
of poetry. In Ruddiman's <i>Edinburgh Weekly Magazine</i>
for 1770, he repeatedly published verses in the Poet's
Corner, with his initials attached, and in subsequent
years he published anonymously the "Cave of Morar,"
"Poetical Legends," and other poems. "The Vanity
of Human Wishes, an Elegy, occasioned by the Untimely
Death of a Scots Poet," appears under the signature
of J. <span class="smcap">Tait</span>, in "Poems on Various Subjects by
Robert Fergusson, Part II.," Edinburgh, 1779, 12mo.
He was admitted as a Writer to the Signet on the 21st
of November 1781; and in July 1805 was appointed
Judge of Police, on a new police system being introduced
into Edinburgh. In the latter capacity he continued
to officiate till July 1812, when a new Act of
Parliament entrusted the settlement of police cases, as
formerly, to the magistrates of the city. Mr Tait died
at his house in Abercromby Place, on the 29th of
August 1817.</p>

<p>"The Banks of the Dee," the only popular production
from the pen of the author, was composed in the
year 1775, on the occasion of a friend leaving Scotland
to join the British forces in America, who were then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
vainly endeavouring to suppress that opposition to the
control of the mother country which resulted in the
permanent establishment of American independence.
The song is set to the Irish air of "Langolee." It was
printed in Wilson's Collection of Songs, which was
published at Edinburgh in 1779, with four additional
stanzas by a Miss Betsy B&mdash;&mdash;s, of inferior merit. It
was re-published in "The Goldfinch" (Edinburgh,
1782), and afterwards was inserted in Johnson's "Musical
Museum." Burns, in his letter to Mr George Thomson,
of 7th April 1793, writes&mdash;"'The Banks of the Dee'
is, you know, literally 'Langolee' to slow time. The
song is well enough, but has some false imagery in it;
for instance&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'And sweetly the nightingale sung from the tree.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the first place, the nightingale sings in a low bush,
but never from a tree; and, in the second place, there
never was a nightingale seen or heard on the banks of
the Dee, or on the banks of any other river in Scotland.
Creative rural imagery is always comparatively flat."</p>

<p>Thirty years after its first appearance, Mr Tait published
a new edition of the song in Mr Thomson's Collection,
vol. iv., in which he has, by alterations on the
first half stanza, acknowledged the justice of the strictures
of the Ayrshire bard. The stanza is altered thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Twas summer, and softly the breezes were blowing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweetly the <i>wood-pigeon coo'd from the tree</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the foot of a rock, where the <i>wild rose was growing</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sat myself down on the banks of the Dee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The song, it may be added, has in several collections
been erroneously attributed to John Home, author of
the tragedy of "Douglas."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="HECTOR_MACNEILL" id="HECTOR_MACNEILL"></a>HECTOR MACNEILL.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Hector Macneill</span> was born on the 22d of October
1746, in the villa of Rosebank, near Roslin; and, to
to use his own words, "amidst the murmur of streams
and the shades of Hawthornden, may be said to have
inhaled with life the atmosphere of a poet."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Descended
from an old family, who possessed a small estate in the
southern district of Argyllshire, his father, after various
changes of fortune, had obtained a company in the 42d
Regiment, with which he served during several campaigns
in Flanders. From continued indisposition, and
consequent inability to undergo the fatigues of military
life, he disposed of his commission, and retired, with
his wife and two children, to the villa of Rosebank, of
which he became the owner. A few years after the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
birth of his son Hector, he felt necessitated, from
straitened circumstances, to quit this beautiful residence;
and he afterwards occupied a farm on the
banks of Loch Lomond. Such a region of the picturesque
was highly suitable for the development of those
poetical talents which had already appeared in young
Hector, amidst the rural amenities of Roslin. In his
eleventh year, he wrote a drama, after the manner of
Gay; and the respectable execution of his juvenile
attempts in versification gained him the approbation of
Dr Doig, the learned rector of the grammar-school of
Stirling, who strongly urged his father to afford him
sufficient instruction, to enable him to enter upon one of
the liberal professions. Had Captain Macneill's circumstances
been prosperous, this counsel might have
been adopted, for the son's promising talents were not
unnoticed by his father; but pecuniary difficulties opposed
an unsurmountable obstacle.</p>

<p>An opulent relative, a West India trader, resident in
Bristol, had paid the captain a visit; and, attracted by
the shrewdness of the son Hector, who was his namesake,
offered to retain him in his employment, and to
provide for him in life. After two years' preparatory
education, he was accordingly sent to Bristol, in his
fourteenth year. He was destined to an adventurous
career, singularly at variance with his early predilections
and pursuits. By his relative he was designed to sail
in a slave ship to the coast of Guinea; but the intercession
of some female friends prevented his being connected
with an expedition so uncongenial to his feelings.
He was now despatched on board a vessel to the island
of St Christopher's, with the view of his making trial of
a seafaring life, but was provided with recommendatory
letters, in the event of his preferring employment on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
land. With a son of the Bristol trader he remained
twelvemonths; and, having no desire to resume his
labours as a seaman, he afterwards sailed for Guadaloupe,
where he continued in the employment of a merchant
for three years, till 1763, when the island was
ceded to the French. Dismissed by his employer, with
a scanty balance of salary, he had some difficulty in
obtaining the means of transport to Antigua; and there,
finding himself reduced to entire dependence, he was
content, without any pecuniary recompense, to become
assistant to his relative, who had come to the town of
St John's. From this unhappy condition he was
rescued, after a short interval. He was possessed of a
knowledge of the French language; a qualification
which, together with his general abilities, recommended
him to fill the office of assistant to the Provost-Marshal
of Grenada. This appointment he held for three years,
when, hearing of the death of his mother and sister,
he returned to Britain. On the death of his father,
eighteen months after his arrival, he succeeded to a
small patrimony, which he proceeded to invest in the
purchase of an annuity of &pound;80 per annum. With this
limited income, he seems to have planned a permanent
settlement in his native country; but the unexpected
embarrassment of the party from whom he had purchased
the annuity, and an attachment of an unfortunate
nature, compelled him to re-embark on the ocean of
adventure. He accepted the office of assistant-secretary
on board Admiral Geary's flag-ship, and made two
cruises with the grand fleet. Proposing again to return
to Scotland, he afterwards resigned his appointment;
but he was induced, by the remonstrances of his friends,
Dr Currie, and Mr Roscoe, of Liverpool, to accept a
similar situation on board the flag-ship of Sir Richard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Bickerton, who had been appointed to take the chief
command of the naval power in India. In this post,
many of the hardships incident to a seafaring life fell to
his share; and being present at the last indecisive
action with "Suffrein," he had likewise to encounter the
perils of war. His present connexion subsisted three
years; but Macneill sickened in the discharge of duties
wholly unsuitable for him, and longed for the comforts
of home. His resources were still limited, but he flattered
himself in the expectation that he might earn a
subsistence as a man of letters. He fixed his residence
at a farm-house in the vicinity of Stirling; and, amidst
the pursuits of literature, the composition of verses, and
the cultivation of friendship, he contrived, for a time, to
enjoy a considerable share of happiness. But he speedily
discovered the delusion of supposing that an individual,
entirely unknown in the literary world, could at
once be able to establish his reputation, and inspire
confidence in the bookselling trade, whose favour is so
essential to men of letters. Discouraged in longer persevering
in the attempt of procuring a livelihood at
home, Macneill, for the fourth time, took his departure
from Britain. Provided with letters of introduction to
influential and wealthy persons in Jamaica, he sailed for
that island on a voyage of adventure; being now in his
thirty-eighth year, and nearly as unprovided for as
when he had first left his native shores, twenty-four
years before. On his arrival at Kingston, he was employed
by the collector of customs, whose acquaintance
he had formed on the voyage; but this official soon
found he could dispense with his services, which he did,
without aiding him in obtaining another situation. The
individuals to whom he had brought letters were unable
or unwilling to render him assistance, and the unfortu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>nate
adventurer was constrained, in his emergency, to
accept the kind invitation of a medical friend, to make
his quarters with him till some satisfactory employment
might occur. He now discovered two intimate companions
of his boyhood settled in the island, in very
prosperous circumstances, and from these he received
both pecuniary aid and the promise of future support.
Through their friendly offices, his two sons, who had
been sent out by a generous friend, were placed in
situations of respectability and emolument. But the
thoughts of the poet himself were directed towards
Britain. He sailed from Jamaica, with a thousand
plans and schemes hovering in his mind, equally vague
and indefinite as had been his aims and designs during
the past chapter of his history. A small sum given him
as the pay of an inland ensigncy, now conferred on him,
but antedated, sufficed to defray the expenses of the
voyage.</p>

<p>Before leaving Scotland for Jamaica, Macneill had
commenced a poem, founded on a Highland tradition;
and to the completion of this production he assiduously
devoted himself during his homeward voyage. It was
published at Edinburgh in 1789, under the title of
"The Harp, a Legendary Tale." In the previous
year, he published a pamphlet in vindication of slavery,
entitled, "On the Treatment of the Negroes in Jamaica."
This pamphlet, written to gratify the wishes of an interested
friend, rather than as the result of his own convictions,
he subsequently endeavoured to suppress. For
several years, Macneill persevered in his unsettled mode
of life. On his return from Jamaica, he resided in the
mansion of his friend, Mr Graham of Gartmore, himself
a writer of verses, as well as a patron of letters; but
a difference with the family caused him to quit this hos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>pitable
residence. After passing some time with his
relatives in Argyllshire, he entertained a proposal of
establishing himself in Glasgow, as partner of a mercantile
house, but this was terminated by the dissolution of
the firm; and a second attempt to succeed in the republic
of letters had an equally unsuccessful issue. In
Edinburgh, whither he had removed, he was seized with
a severe nervous illness, which, during the six following
years, rendered him incapable of sustained physical
exertion. With a little money, which he contrived to
raise on his annuity, he retired to a small cottage at St
Ninians; but his finances again becoming reduced, he
accepted of the hospitable invitation of his friends,
Major Spark and his lady, to become the inmate of
their residence of Viewforth House, Stirling. At this
period, Macneill composed the greater number of his
best songs, and produced his poem of "Scotland's
Skaith, or the History of Will and Jean," which was
published in 1795, and speedily gained him a wide
reputation. Before the close of twelvemonths, it passed
through no fewer than fourteen editions. A sequel, entitled
"The Waes o' War," which appeared in 1796,
attained nearly an equal popularity. The original
ballad was composed during the author's solitary walks
along the promenades of the King's Park, Stirling,
while he was still suffering mental depression. It was
completed in his own mind before any of the stanzas
were committed to paper.</p>

<p>The hope of benefiting his enfeebled constitution
in a warm climate induced him to revisit Jamaica.
As a parting tribute to his friends at Stirling, he
published, in 1799, immediately before his departure,
a descriptive poem, entitled "The Links of Forth, or a
Parting Peep at the Carse of Stirling," which, regarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
as the last effort of a dying poet, obtained a reception
fully equal to its merits.</p>

<p>On the oft-disappointed and long unfortunate poet
the sun of prosperity at length arose. On his arrival in
Jamaica, one of his early friends, Mr John Graham, of
Three-Mile-River, settled on him an annuity of &pound;100
a-year; and, in a few months afterwards, they sailed
together for Britain, the poet's health being essentially
improved. Macneill now fixed his permanent residence
in Edinburgh, and, with the proceeds of several
legacies bequeathed to him, together with his annuity,
was enabled to live in comparative affluence. The narrative
of his early adventures and hardships is supposed
to form the basis of a novel, entitled "The Memoirs of
Charles Macpherson, Esq.," which proceeded from his
pen in 1800. In the following year, he published a
complete edition of his poetical works, in two duodecimo
volumes. In 1809, he published "The Pastoral,
or Lyric Muse of Scotland," in a thin quarto volume;
and about the same time, anonymously, two other works
in verse, entitled "Town Fashions, or Modern Manners
Delineated," and "Bygone Times and Late-come
Changes." His last work, "The Scottish Adventurers,"
a novel, appeared in 1812, in two octavo
volumes.</p>

<p>The latter productions of Hector Macneill, both in
prose and verse, tended rather to diminish than increase
his fame. They exhibit the sentiments of a querulous
old man, inclined to cling to the habits of his youth,
and to regard any improvement as an act of ruthless
innovation. As the author of some excellent songs, and
one of the most popular ballads in the Scottish language,
his name will continue to be remembered. His songs,
"Mary of Castlecary," "My boy, Tammie," "Come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
under my plaidie," "I lo'ed ne'er a laddie but ane,"
"Donald and Flora," and "Dinna think, bonnie lassie,"
will retain a firm hold of the popular mind. His characteristic
is tenderness and pathos, combined with
unity of feeling, and a simplicity always genuine and
true to nature. Allan Cunningham, who forms only a
humble estimate of his genius, remarks that his songs
"have much softness and truth, an insinuating grace of
manners, and a decorum of expression, with no small
skill in the dramatic management of the stories."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The
ballad of "Scotland's Skaith" ranks among the happiest
conceptions of the Scottish Doric muse; rural life is
depicted with singular force and accuracy, and the debasing
consequences of the inordinate use of ardent
spirits among the peasantry, are delineated with a vigour
and power, admirably adapted to suit the author's benevolent
intention in the suppression of intemperance.</p>

<p>During his latter years, Macneill was much cherished
among the fashionables of the capital. He was a tall,
venerable-looking old man; and although his complexion
was sallow, and his countenance somewhat austere,
his agreeable and fascinating conversation, full of
humour and replete with anecdote, rendered him an
acceptable guest in many social circles. He displayed
a lively, but not a vigorous intellect, and his literary
attainments were inconsiderable. Of his own character
as a man of letters, he had evidently formed a
high estimate. He was prone to satire, but did not
unduly indulge in it. He was especially impatient of
indifferent versification; and, among his friends, rather
discouraged than commended poetical composition.
Though long unsettled himself, he was loud in his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>commendations
of industry; and, from the gay man of the
world, he became earnest on the subject of religion.
For several years, his health seems to have been unsatisfactory.
In a letter to a friend, dated Edinburgh,
January 30, 1813, he writes:&mdash;"Accumulating years
and infirmities are beginning to operate very sensibly
upon me now, and yearly do I experience their increasing
influence. Both my hearing and my sight are considerably
weakened, and, should I live a few years
longer, I look forward to a state which, with all our love
for life, is certainly not to be envied.... My pen is
my chief amusement. Reading soon fatigues, and loses
its zest; composition never, till over-exertion reminds me
of my imprudence, by sensations which too frequently
render me unpleasant during the rest of the day." On
the 15th of March 1818, in his seventy-second year, the
poet breathed his last, in entire composure, and full of
hope.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="MRS_GRANT_OF_LAGGAN" id="MRS_GRANT_OF_LAGGAN"></a>MRS GRANT OF LAGGAN.</h2>


<p>Mrs Anne Grant, commonly styled of Laggan, to distinguish
her from her contemporary, Mrs Grant of
Carron, was born at Glasgow, in February 1755. Her
father, Mr Duncan Macvicar, was an officer in the army,
and, by her mother, she was descended from the old
family of Stewart, of Invernahyle, in Argyllshire. Her
early infancy was passed at Fort-William; but her
father having accompanied his regiment to America,
and there become a settler, in the State of New York,
at a very tender age she was taken by her mother
across the Atlantic, to her new home. Though her
third year had not been completed when she arrived in
America, she retained a distinct recollection of her landing
at Charlestown. By her mother she was taught to
read, and a well-informed serjeant made her acquainted
with writing. Her precocity for learning was remarkable.
Ere she had reached her sixth year, she had
made herself familiar with the Old Testament, and
could speak the Dutch language, which she had learned
from a family of Dutch settlers. The love of poetry
and patriotism was simultaneously evinced. At this
early period, she read Milton's "Paradise Lost" with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
attention, and even appreciation; and glowed with the
enthusiastic ardour of a young heroine over the adventures
of Wallace, detailed in the metrical history of
Henry, the Minstrel. Her juvenile talent attracted
the notice of the more intelligent settlers in the State,
and gained her the friendship of the distinguished
Madame Schuyler, whose virtues she afterwards depicted
in her "Memoirs of an American Lady."</p>

<p>In 1768, along with his wife and daughter, Mr Macvicar
returned to Scotland, his health having suffered
by his residence in America; and, during the three following
summers, his daughter found means of gratifying
her love of song, on the banks of the Cart, near Glasgow.
The family residence was now removed to Fort-Augustus,
where Mr Macvicar had received the appointment
of barrack-master. The chaplain of the fort was
the Rev. James Grant, a young clergyman, related to
several of the more respectable families in the district,
who was afterwards appointed minister of the parish of
Laggan, in Inverness-shire. At Fort-Augustus, he had
recommended himself to the affections of Miss Macvicar,
by his elegant tastes and accomplished manners, and he
now became the successful suitor for her hand. They
were married in 1779, and Mrs Grant, to approve herself
a useful helpmate to her husband, began assiduously
to acquaint herself with the manners and habits of the
humbler classes of the people. The inquiries instituted
at this period were turned to an account more extensive
than originally contemplated. Mr Grant, who was constitutionally
delicate, died in 1801, leaving his widow
and eight surviving children without any means of
support, his worldly circumstances being considerably
embarrassed.</p>

<p>On a small farm which she had rented, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
vicinity of her late husband's parish, Mrs Grant resided
immediately subsequent to his decease; but the profits
of the lease were evidently inadequate for the comfortable
maintenance of the family. Among the circle of
her friends she was known as a writer of verses; in her
ninth year, she had essayed an imitation of Milton; and
she had written poetry, or at least verses, on the banks
of the Cart and at Fort-Augustus. To aid in supporting
her family, she was strongly advised to collect her
pieces into a volume; and, to encourage her in acting
upon this recommendation, no fewer than three thousand
subscribers were procured for the work by her friends.
The celebrated Duchess of Gordon proved an especial
promoter of the cause. In 1803, a volume of poems
appeared from her pen, which, though displaying no
high powers, was favourably received, and had the
double advantage of making her known, and of materially
aiding her finances. From the profits, she made
settlement of her late husband's liabilities; and now
perceiving a likelihood of being able to support her
family by her literary exertions, she abandoned the
lease of her farm. She took up her residence near
the town of Stirling, residing in the mansion of Gartur,
in that neighbourhood. In 1806, she again appeared
before the public as an author, by publishing a selection
of her correspondence with her friends, in three duodecimo
volumes, under the designation of "Letters from
the Mountains." This work passed through several
editions. In 1808, Mrs Grant published the life of
her early friend, Madame Schuyler, under the designation
of "Memoirs of an American Lady," in two
volumes.</p>

<p>From the rural retirement of Gartur, she soon removed
to the town of Stirling; but in 1810, as her circum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>stances
became more prosperous, she took up her permanent
abode in Edinburgh. Some distinguished literary
characters of the Scottish capital now resorted to her
society. She was visited by Sir Walter Scott, Francis
Jeffrey, James Hogg, and others, attracted by the
vivacity of her conversation. The "Essays on the
Superstitions of the Highlanders of Scotland" appeared
in 1811, in two volumes; in 1814, she published a
metrical work, in two parts, entitled "Eighteen Hundred
and Thirteen;" and, in the year following, she
produced her "Popular Models and Impressive Warnings
for the Sons and Daughters of Industry."</p>

<p>In 1825, Mrs Grant received a civil-list pension of
&pound;50 a-year, in consideration of her literary talents,
which, with the profits of her works and the legacies of
several deceased friends, rendered the latter period of
her life sufficiently comfortable in respect of pecuniary
means. She died on the 7th of November 1838, in the
eighty-fourth year of her age, and retaining her faculties
to the last. A collection of her correspondence was
published in 1844, in three volumes octavo, edited by
her only surviving son, John P. Grant, Esq.</p>

<p>As a writer, Mrs Grant occupies a respectable place.
She had the happy art of turning her every-day observation,
as well as the fruits of her research, to the best
account. Her letters, which she published at the commencement
of her literary career, as well as those which
appeared posthumously, are favourable specimens of
that species of composition. As a poet, she attained to
no eminence. "The Highlanders," her longest and
most ambitious poetical effort, exhibits some glowing
descriptions of mountain scenery, and the stern though
simple manners of the Ga&euml;l. Of a few songs which
proceed from her pen, that commencing, "Oh, where,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
tell me where?" written on the occasion of the Marquis
of Huntly's departure for Holland with his regiment, in
1799, has only become generally known. It has been
parodied in a song, by an unknown author, entitled
"The Blue Bells of Scotland," which has obtained
a wider range of popularity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="JOHN_MAYNE" id="JOHN_MAYNE"></a>JOHN MAYNE.</h2>


<p>John Mayne, chiefly known as the author of "The
Siller Gun," a poem descriptive of burgher habits in
Scotland towards the close of the century, was born at
Dumfries, on the 26th of March 1759. At the grammar
school of his native town, under Dr Chapman, the
learned rector, whose memory he has celebrated in the
third canto of his principal poem, he had the benefit of
a respectable elementary education; and having chosen
the profession of a printer, he entered at an early age
the printing office of the <i>Dumfries Journal</i>. In 1782,
when his parents removed to Glasgow, to reside on a
little property to which they had succeeded, he sought
employment under the celebrated Messrs Foulis, in
whose printing establishment he continued during the
five following years. He paid a visit to London in
1785, with the view of advancing his professional interests,
and two years afterwards he settled in the metropolis.</p>

<p>Mayne, while a mere stripling, was no unsuccessful
wooer of the Muse; and in his sixteenth year he produced
the germ of that poem on which his reputation
chiefly depends. This production, entitled "The Siller
Gun," descriptive of a sort of <i>walkingshaw</i>, or an an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>cient
practice which obtained in his native town, of
shooting, on the king's birth-day, for a silver tube or
gun, which had been presented by James VI. to the
incorporated trades, as a prize to the best marksman,
was printed at Dumfries in 1777, on a small quarto
page. The original edition consisted of twelve stanzas;
in two years it increased to two cantos; in 1780, it was
printed in three cantos; in 1808, it was published in
London with a fourth; and in 1836, just before his
death, the author added a fifth. The latest edition was
published by subscription, in an elegant duodecimo
volume.</p>

<p>In 1780, in the pages of Ruddiman's <i>Weekly Magazine</i>,
Mayne published a short poem on "Halloween,"
which suggested Burns's celebrated poem on the same
subject. In 1781, he published at Glasgow his song of
"Logan Braes," of which Burns afterwards composed a
new version.</p>

<p>In London, Mayne was first employed as printer, and
subsequently became joint-editor and proprietor, along
with Dr Tilloch, of the <i>Star</i> evening newspaper. With
this journal he retained a connexion till his death, which
took place at London on the 14th of March 1836.</p>

<p>Besides the humorous and descriptive poem of "The
Siller Gun," which, in the opinion of Sir Walter Scott,
surpasses the efforts of Ferguson, and comes near to
those of Burns,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Mayne published another epic production,
entitled "Glasgow," which appeared in 1803, and
has passed through several editions. In the same year
he published "English, Scots, and Irishmen," a chivalrous
address to the population of the three kingdoms.
To the literary journals, his contributions, both in prose
and verse, were numerous and interesting. Many of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
songs and ballads enriched the columns of the journal
which he so long and ably conducted. In early life, he
maintained a metrical correspondence with Thomas
Telford, the celebrated engineer, who was a native of
the same county, and whose earliest ambition was to
earn the reputation of a poet.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Possessed of entire amiability of disposition, and the
utmost amenity of manners, John Mayne was warmly
beloved among the circle of his friends. Himself embued
with a deep sense of religion, though fond of innocent
humour, he preserved in all his writings a becoming
respect for sound morals, and is entitled to the commendation
which a biographer has awarded him, of
having never committed to paper a single line "the
tendency of which was not to afford innocent amusement,
or to improve and increase the happiness of mankind."
He was singularly modest and even retiring.
His eulogy has been pronounced by Allan Cunningham,
who knew him well, that "a better or warmer-hearted
man never existed." The songs, of which we have
selected the more popular, abound in vigour of expression
and sentiment, and are pervaded by a genuine
pathos.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="JOHN_HAMILTON" id="JOHN_HAMILTON"></a>JOHN HAMILTON.</h2>


<p>Of the personal history of John Hamilton only a few
particulars can be ascertained. He carried on business
for many years as a music-seller in North Bridge Street,
Edinburgh, and likewise gave instructions in the art of
instrumental music to private families. He had the
good fortune to attract the favour of one of his fair
pupils&mdash;a young lady of birth and fortune&mdash;whom he
married, much to the displeasure of her relations. He
fell into impaired health, and died on the 23d of September
1814, in the fifty-third year of his age. To the
lovers of Scottish melody the name of Mr Hamilton is
familiar, as a composer of several esteemed and beautiful
airs. His contributions to the department of Scottish
song entitle his name to an honourable place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="JOANNA_BAILLIE" id="JOANNA_BAILLIE"></a>JOANNA BAILLIE.</h2>


<p>Joanna Baillie was born on the 11th of September
1762, in the manse of Bothwell, in Lanarkshire. Her
father, Dr James Baillie, was descended from the old
family of Baillie of Lamington, and was consequently
entitled to claim propinquity with the distinguished
Principal Robert Baillie, and the family of Baillie of
Jerviswood, so celebrated for its Christian patriotism.
The mother of Joanna likewise belonged to an honourable
house: she was a descendant of the Hunters of
Hunterston; and her two brothers attained a wide reputation
in the world of science&mdash;Dr William Hunter
being an eminent physician, and Mr John Hunter the
greatest anatomist of his age. Joanna&mdash;a twin, the
other child being still-born&mdash;was the youngest of a
family of three children. Her only brother was Dr
Matthew Baillie, highly distinguished in the medical
world. Agnes, her sister, who was eldest of the family, remained
unmarried, and continued to live with her under
the same roof.</p>

<p>In the year 1768, Dr Baillie was transferred from the
parochial charge of Bothwell to the office of collegiate
minister of Hamilton,&mdash;a town situate, like his former
parish, on the banks of the Clyde. He was subse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>quently
elected Professor of Divinity in the University
of Glasgow. After his death, which took place in 1778,
his daughters both continued, along with their widowed
mother, to live at Long Calderwood, in the vicinity of
Hamilton, until 1784, when they all accepted an invitation
to reside with Dr Matthew Baillie, who had
entered on his medical career in London, and had
become possessor of a house in Great Windmill Street,
built by his now deceased uncle, Dr Hunter.</p>

<p>Though evincing no peculiar promptitude in the acquisition
of learning, Joanna had, at the very outset of
life, exhibited remarkable talent in rhyme-making. She
composed verses before she could read, and, before she
could have fancied a theatre, formed dialogues for dramatic
representations, which she carried on with her
companions. But she did not early seek distinction as
an author. At the somewhat mature age of twenty-eight,
after she had gone to London, she first published,
and that anonymously, a volume of miscellaneous
poems, which did not excite any particular attention.
In 1798, she published, though anonymously at first,
"A Series of Plays: in which it is attempted to delineate
the stronger Passions of the Mind, each Passion
being the subject of a Tragedy and a Comedy." In a
lengthened preliminary dissertation, she discoursed regarding
the drama in all its relations, maintaining the
ascendency of simple nature over every species of adornment
and decoration. "Let one simple trait of the
human heart, one expression of passion, genuine and
true to nature," she wrote, "be introduced, and it will
stand forth alone in the boldness of reality, whilst the
false and unnatural around it fades away upon every
side, like the rising exhalations of the morning." The
reception of these plays was sufficient to satisfy the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
utmost ambition of the author, and established the foundation
of her fame. "Nothing to compare with them
had been produced since the great days of the English
drama; and the truth, vigour, variety, and dignity of
the dramatic portraits, in which they abound, might well
justify an enthusiasm which a reader of the present day
can scarcely be expected to feel. This enthusiasm
was all the greater, when it became known that these
remarkable works, which had been originally published
anonymously, were from the pen of a woman still
young, who had passed her life in domestic seclusion."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Encouraged by the success of the first volume of her
dramas on the "Passions," the author added a second in
1802, and a third in 1812. During the interval, she
published a volume of miscellaneous dramas in 1804,
and produced the "Family Legend" in 1810,&mdash;a
tragedy, founded upon a Highland tradition. With a
prologue by Sir Walter Scott, and an epilogue by
Henry Mackenzie, the "Family Legend" was produced
at the Edinburgh theatre, under the auspices of the former
illustrious character; and was ably supported by Mrs
Siddons, and by Terry, then at the commencement of
his career. It was favourably received during ten successive
performances. "You have only to imagine all
that you could wish to give success to a play," wrote Sir
Walter Scott to the author, "and your conceptions will
still fall short of the complete and decided triumph of
the 'Family Legend.' The house was crowded to a
most extraordinary degree; many people had come from
your native capital of the west; everything that pretended
to distinction, whether from rank or literature,
was in the boxes; and in the pit, such an aggregate
mass of humanity as I have seldom, if ever, witnessed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
in the same space." Other two of her plays, "Count
Basil" and "De Montfort," brought out in London, the
latter being sustained by Kemble and Siddons, likewise
received a large measure of general approbation; but a
want of variety of incident prevented their retaining a
position on the stage. In 1836, she produced three
additional volumes of dramas; her career as a dramatic
writer thus extending over the period of nearly forty
years.</p>

<p>Subsequent to her leaving Scotland, in 1784, Joanna
Baillie did not return to her native kingdom, unless on
occasional visits. On the marriage of her brother to a
sister of the Lord Chief-Justice Denman, in 1791, she
passed some years at Colchester; but she subsequently
fixed her permanent habitation at Hampstead. Her
mother died in 1806. At Hampstead, in the companionship
of her only sister, whose virtues she has celebrated
in one of her poems, and amidst the society of
many of the more distinguished literary characters of
the metropolis, she continued to enjoy a large amount
of comfort and happiness. Her pecuniary means were
sufficiently abundant, and rendered her entirely independent
of the profits of her writings. Among her literary
friends, one of the most valued was Sir Walter
Scott, who, being introduced to her personal acquaintance
on his visit to London in 1806, maintained with
her an affectionate and lasting intimacy. The letters
addressed to her are amongst the most interesting of his
correspondence in his Memoir by his son-in-law. He
evinced his estimation of her genius by frequently complimenting
her in his works. In his "Epistle to William
Erskine," which forms the introduction to the
third canto of "Marmion," he thus generously eulogises
his gifted friend:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Or, if to touch such chord be thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Restore the ancient tragic line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And emulate the notes that wrung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the wild harp, which silent hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By silver Avon's holy shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till twice a hundred years roll'd o'er;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she, the bold Enchantress, came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fearless hand and heart on flame!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the pale willow snatch'd the treasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swept it with a kindred measure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Avon's swans, while rung the grove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Montfort's hate and Basil's love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awakening at the inspir&eacute;d strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deem'd their own Shakspeare lived again."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To Joanna, Scott inscribed his fragmental drama of
"Macduff's Cross," which was included in a Miscellany
published by her in 1823.</p>

<p>Though a penury of incident, and a defectiveness of
skill in sustaining an increasing interest to the close,
will probably prevent any of her numerous plays from
being renewed on the stage, Joanna Baillie is well
entitled to the place assigned her as one of the first
of modern dramatists. In all her plays there are passages
and scenes surpassed by no contemporaneous
dramatic writer. Her works are a magazine of eloquent
thoughts and glowing descriptions. She is a mistress
of the emotions, and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i11">"Within <i>her</i> mighty page,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each tyrant passion shews his woe and rage."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The tragedies of "Count Basil" and "De Montfort"
are her best plays, and are well termed by Sir Walter
Scott a revival of the great Bard of Avon. Forcible
and energetic in style, her strain never becomes turgid
or diverges into commonplace. She is masculine, but
graceful; and powerful without any ostentation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
strength. Her personal history was the counterpart of
her writings. Gentle in manners and affable in conversation,
she was a model of the household virtues, and
would have attracted consideration as a woman by her
amenities, though she had possessed no reputation in
the world of letters. She was eminently religious and
benevolent. Her countenance bore indication of a superior
intellect and deep penetration. Though her society
was much cherished by her contemporaries, including
distinguished foreigners who visited the metropolis, her
life was spent in general retirement. She was averse to
public demonstration, and seemed scarcely conscious of
her power. She died at Hampstead, on the 23d of
February 1851, at the very advanced age of eighty-nine,
and a few weeks after the publication of her whole
Works in a collected form.</p>

<p>The songs of Joanna Baillie immediately obtained an
honourable place in the minstrelsy of her native kingdom.
They are the simple and graceful effusions of a
heart passionately influenced by the melodies of the
"land of the heath and the thistle," and animated by
those warm affections so peculiarly nurtured in the region
of "the mountain and the flood." "Fy, let us a' to the
wedding," "Saw ye Johnnie comin'?" "It fell on a morning
when we were thrang," and "Woo'd, and married, and
a'," maintain popularity among all classes of Scotsmen
throughout the world. Several of the songs were written
for Thomson's "Melodies," and "The Harp of Caledonia,"
a collection of songs published at Glasgow in
1821, in three vols. 12mo, under the editorial care of
John Struthers, author of "The Poor Man's Sabbath."
The greater number are included in the present work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="WILLIAM_DUDGEON" id="WILLIAM_DUDGEON"></a>WILLIAM DUDGEON.</h2>


<p>Though the author of a single popular song, William
Dudgeon is entitled to a place among the modern contributors
to the Caledonian minstrelsy. Of his personal
history, only a very few facts have been recovered. He
was the son of a farmer in East-Lothian, and himself
rented an extensive farm at Preston, in Berwickshire.
During his border tour in May 1787, the poet Burns
met him at Berrywell, the residence of the father of his
friend Mr Robert Ainslie, who acted as land-steward on
the estate of Lord Douglas in the Merse. In his journal,
Burns has thus recorded his impression of the
meeting:&mdash;"A Mr Dudgeon, a poet at times, a worthy,
remarkable character, natural penetration, a great deal
of information, some genius, and extreme modesty."
Dudgeon died in October 1813, about his sixtieth year.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="WILLIAM_REID" id="WILLIAM_REID"></a>WILLIAM REID.</h2>


<p>William Reid was born at Glasgow on the 10th of
April 1764. His father, a baker by trade, was enabled
to give him a good education at the school of his native
city. At an early age he was apprenticed to Messrs
Dunlop and Wilson, booksellers; and in the year 1790,
along with another enterprising individual, he commenced
a bookselling establishment, under the firm of
"Brash and Reid." In this business, both partners
became eminently successful, their shop being frequented
by the <i>literati</i> of the West. The poet Burns
cultivated the society of Mr Reid, who proved a warm
friend, as he was an ardent admirer, of the Ayrshire
bard. He was an enthusiastic patron of literature, was
fond of social humour, and a zealous promoter of the
interests of Scottish song. Between 1795 and 1798, the
firm published in numbers, at one penny each, "Poetry,
Original and Selected," which extended to four volumes.
To this publication, both Mr Reid, and his partner, Mr
Brash, made some original contributions. The work is
now very scarce, and is accounted valuable by collectors.
Mr Reid died at Glasgow, on the 29th of November
1831, leaving a widow and a family.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="ALEXANDER_CAMPBELL" id="ALEXANDER_CAMPBELL"></a>ALEXANDER CAMPBELL.</h2>


<p>A miscellaneous writer, a poet, and a musical composer,
Alexander Campbell first saw the light at Tombea,
on the banks of Loch Lubnaig, in Perthshire. He
was born in 1764, and received such education as his
parents could afford him, which was not very ample, at
the parish school of Callander. An early taste for
music induced him to proceed to Edinburgh, there to
cultivate a systematic acquaintance with the art. Acquiring
a knowledge of the science under the celebrated
Tenducci and others, he became himself a teacher of
the harpsichord and of vocal music, in the metropolis.
As an upholder of Jacobitism, when it was scarcely to
be dreaded as a political offence, he officiated as organist
in a non-juring chapel in the vicinity of Nicolson Street;
and while so employed had the good fortune to form the
acquaintance of Burns, who was pleased to discover in
an individual entertaining similar state sentiments with
himself, an enthusiastic devotion to national melody
and song.</p>

<p>Mr Campbell was twice married; his second wife was
the widow of a Highland gentleman, and he was induced
to hope that his condition might thus be permanently
improved. He therefore relinquished his original<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
vocation, and commenced the study of physic, with the
view of obtaining an appointment as surgeon in the public
service; but his sanguine hopes proved abortive, and,
to complete his mortification, his wife left him in Edinburgh,
and sought a retreat in the Highlands. He
again procured some employment as a teacher of music;
and about the year 1810, one of his expedients was to
give lessons in drawing. He was a man of a fervent
spirit, and possessed of talents, which, if they had
been adequately cultivated, and more concentrated, might
have enabled him to attain considerable distinction;
but, apparently aiming at the reputation of universal
genius, he alternately cultivated the study of music,
poetry, painting, and physic. At a more recent period,
Sir Walter Scott found him occasional employment in
transcribing manuscripts; and during the unhappy remainder
of his life he had to struggle with many difficulties.</p>

<p>One of his publications bears the title of "Odes and
Miscellaneous Poems, by a Student of Medicine in the
University of Edinburgh," Edinburgh, 1790, 4to. These
lucubrations, which attracted no share of public attention,
were followed by "The Guinea Note, a Poem, by
Timothy Twig, Esquire," Edinburgh, 1797, 4to. His
next work is entitled, "An Introduction to the History
of Poetry in Scotland, with Illustrations by David Allan,"
Edinburgh, 1798, 4to. This work, though written in a
rambling style, contains a small proportion of useful
materials very unskilfully digested. "A Dialogue on
Scottish Music," prefixed, had the merit of conveying to
Continental musicians for the first time a correct acquaintance
with the Scottish scale, the author receiving the
commendations of the greatest Italian and German composers.
The work likewise contains "Songs of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Lowlands," a selection of some of the more interesting
specimens of the older minstrelsy. In 1802 he published
"A Tour from Edinburgh through various parts
of North Britain," in two volumes quarto, illustrated
with engravings from sketches executed by himself.
This work met with a favourable reception, and has
been regarded as the most successful of his literary
efforts. In 1804 he sought distinction as a poet by
giving to the world "The Grampians Desolate," a long
poem, in one volume octavo. In this production he
essays "to call the attention of good men, wherever dispersed
throughout our island, to the manifold and great
evils arising from the introduction of that system which
has within these last forty years spread among the
Grampians and Western Isles, and is the leading cause
of a depopulation that threatens to extirpate the ancient
race of the inhabitants of those districts." That system
to which Mr Campbell refers, he afterwards explains to
be the monopoly of sheep-stores, a subject scarcely poetical,
but which he has contrived to clothe with considerable
smoothness of versification. The last work which
issued from Mr Campbell's pen was "Albyn's Anthology,
a Select Collection of the Melodies and Vocal Poetry
Peculiar to Scotland and the Isles, hitherto Unpublished."
The publication appeared in 1816, in two parts, of elegant
folio. It was adorned by the contributions of Sir
Walter Scott, James Hogg, and other poets of reputation.
The preface contains "An Epitome of the History
of Scottish Poetry and Music from the Earliest Times."
His musical talents have a stronger claim to remembrance
than either his powers as a poet or his skill as
a writer. Yet his industry was unremitted, and his
researches have proved serviceable to other writers who
have followed him on the same themes. Only a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
lyrical pieces proceeded from his pen; these were first
published in "Albyn's Anthology." From this work
we have extracted two specimens.</p>

<p>Mr Campbell died of apoplexy on the 15th of May
1824, after a life much chequered by misfortune. He
left various MSS. on subjects connected with his favourite
studies, which have fortunately found their way
into the possession of Mr Laing, to whom the history of
Scottish poetry is perhaps more indebted than to any
other living writer. The poems in this collection, though
bearing marks of sufficient elaboration, could not be
recommended for publication. Mr Campbell was understood
to be a contributor to <i>The Ghost</i>, a forgotten
periodical, which ran a short career in the year 1790.
It was published in Edinburgh twice a week, and
reached the forty-sixth number; the first having appeared
on the 25th of April, the last on the 16th of
November. He published an edition of a book, curious
in its way&mdash;Donald Mackintosh's "Collection of Gaelic
Proverbs, and Familiar Phrases; Englished anew!"
Edinburgh, 1819, 12mo. The preface contains a characteristic
account of the compiler, who described himself
as "a priest of the old Scots Episcopal Church,
and last of the non-jurant clergy in Scotland."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

She was the third daughter of the Hon. George Cranstoun,
youngest son of William, fifth Lord Cranstoun.
She was born in the year 1765, and became the wife
of Professor Dugald Stewart on the 26th July 1790.
Having survived her husband ten years, she died at
Warriston House, in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh,

<h2><a name="ALEXANDER_WILSON" id="ALEXANDER_WILSON"></a>ALEXANDER WILSON.</h2>


<p>The author of the celebrated "American Ornithology"
is entitled to an honourable commemoration as one of
the minstrels of his native land. Alexander Wilson was
born at Paisley on the 6th of July 1766. His father
had for some time carried on a small trade as a distiller;
but the son was destined by his parents for the clerical
profession, in the National Church&mdash;a scheme which was
frustrated by the death of his mother in his tenth year,
leaving a large family of children to the sole care of his
father. He had, however, considerably profited by the
instruction already received at school; and having derived
from his mother a taste for music and a relish for
books, he invoked the muse in solitude, and improved
his mind by miscellaneous reading. His father contracted
a second marriage when Alexander had reached his
thirteenth year; and it became necessary that he should
prepare himself for entering upon some handicraft employment.
He became an apprentice to his brother-in-law,
William Duncan, a weaver in his native town;
and on completing his indenture, he wrought as a journeyman,
during the three following years, in the towns
of Paisley, Lochwinnoch, and Queensferry. But the
occupation of weaving, which had from the first been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
unsuitable to his tastes, growing altogether irksome, he
determined to relinquish it for a vocation which, if in
some respects scarcely more desirable, afforded him
ample means of gratifying his natural desire of becoming
familiar with the topography of his native country. He
provided himself with a pack, as a pedlar, and in this
capacity, in company with his brother-in-law, continued
for three years to lead a wandering life. His devotedness
to verse-making had continued unabated from boyhood;
he had written verses at the loom, and had
become an enthusiastic votary of the muse during his
peregrinations with his pack. He was now in his
twenty-third year; and with the buoyancy of ardent
youth, he thought of offering to the public a volume of
his poems by subscription. In this attempt he was not
successful; nor would any bookseller listen to proposals
of publishing the lucubrations of an obscure pedlar. In
1790, he at length contrived to print his poems at
Paisley, on his own account, in the hope of being able to
dispose of them along with his other wares. But this
attempt was not more successful than his original
scheme, so that he was compelled to return to his father's
house at Lochwinnoch, and resume the obnoxious shuttle.
His aspirations for poetical distinction were not, however,
subdued; he heard of the institution of the <i>Forum</i>,
a debating society established in Edinburgh by some
literary aspirants, and learning, in 1791, that an early
subject of discussion was the comparative merits of
Ramsay and Fergusson as Scottish poets, he prepared
to take a share in the competition. By doubling his
hours of labour at the loom, he procured the means of
defraying his travelling expenses; and, arriving in time
for the debate in the <i>Forum</i>, he repeated a poem which
he had prepared, entitled the "Laurel Disputed," in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
which he gave the preference to Fergusson. He remained
several weeks in Edinburgh, and printed his
poem. To Dr Anderson's "Bee" he contributed several
poems, and a prose essay, entitled "The Solitary
Philosopher." Finding no encouragement to settle in
the metropolis, he once more returned to his father's
house in the west. He now formed the acquaintance of
Robert Burns, who testified his esteem for him both as
a man and a poet. In 1792, he published anonymously
his popular ballad of "Watty and Meg," which he had
the satisfaction to find regarded as worthy of the Ayrshire
Bard.</p>

<p>The star of the poet was now promising to be in the
ascendant, but an untoward event ensued. In the
ardent enthusiasm of his temperament, he was induced
to espouse in verse the cause of the Paisley hand-loom
operatives in a dispute with their employers, and to
satirise in strong invective a person of irreproachable
reputation. For this offence he was prosecuted before
the sheriff, who sentenced him to be imprisoned for a
few days, and publicly to burn his own poem in the
front of the jail. This satire is entitled "The Shark;
or, Long Mills detected." Like many other independents,
he mistook anarchy in France for the dawn of
liberty in Europe; and his sentiments becoming known,
he was so vigilantly watched by the authorities, that he
found it was no longer expedient for him to reside in
Scotland. He resolved to emigrate to America; and,
contriving by four months' extra labour, and living on
a shilling weekly, to earn his passage-money, he sailed
from Portpatrick to Belfast, and from thence to Newcastle,
in the State of Delaware, where he arrived on the
14th July 1794. During the voyage he had slept on
deck, and when he landed, his finances consisted only of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
a few shillings; yet, with a cheerful heart, he walked to
Philadelphia, a distance of thirty-three miles, with only
his fowling-piece on his shoulder. He shot a red-headed
woodpecker by the way,&mdash;an omen of his future pursuits,
for hitherto he had devoted no attention to the study of
ornithology.</p>

<p>He was first employed by a copperplate-printer in
Philadelphia, but quitted this occupation for the loom,
at which he worked about a year in Philadelphia,
and at Shepherdstown, in Virginia. In 1795, he traversed
a large portion of the State of New Jersey as a
pedlar, keeping a journal,&mdash;a practice which he had followed
during his wandering life in Scotland. He now
adopted the profession of a schoolmaster, and was successively
employed in this vocation at Frankford, in
Pennsylvania, at Milestown, and at Bloomfield, in New
Jersey. In preparing himself for the instruction of
others, he essentially extended his own acquaintance
with classical learning, and mathematical science; and
by occasional employment as a land-surveyor, he somewhat
improved his finances. In 1801, he accepted the
appointment of teacher in a seminary in Kingsessing, on
the river Schuylkill, about four miles from Philadelphia,&mdash;a
situation which, though attended with limited emolument,
proved the first step in his path to eminence. He
was within a short distance of the residence of William
Bartram, the great American naturalist, with whom he
became intimately acquainted; he also formed the friendship
of Alexander Lawson, an emigrant engraver, who
initiated him in the art of etching, colouring, and engraving.
Discovering an aptitude in the accurate delineation
of birds, he was led to the study of ornithology;
with which he became so much interested, that he projected
a work descriptive, with drawings, of all the birds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
of the Middle States, and even of the Union. About this
period he became a contributor to the "Literary Magazine,"
conducted by Mr Brockden Brown, and to Denny's
"Portfolio."</p>

<p>Along with a nephew and another friend, Wilson
made a pedestrian tour to the Falls of Niagara, in October
1804, and on his return published in the "Portfolio"
a poetical narrative of his journey, entitled "The
Foresters,"&mdash;a production surpassing his previous efforts,
and containing some sublime apostrophes. But his
energies were now chiefly devoted to the accomplishment
of the grand design he had contemplated. Disappointed
in obtaining the co-operation of his friend Mr
Lawson, who was alarmed at the extent of his projected
adventure, and likewise frustrated in obtaining pecuniary
assistance from the President Jefferson, on which he
had some reason to calculate, he persevered in his attempts
himself, drawing, etching, and colouring the
requisite illustrations. In 1806, he was employed as
assistant-editor of a new edition of Rees' Cyclopedia, by
Mr Samuel Bradford, bookseller in Philadelphia, who rewarded
his services with a liberal salary, and undertook,
at his own risk, the publication of his "Ornithology."
The first volume of the work appeared in September
1808, and immediately after its publication the author personally
visited, in the course of two different expeditions,
the Eastern and Southern States, in quest of subscribers.
These journeys were attended with a success scarcely
adequate to the privations which were experienced in
their prosecution; but the "Ornithology" otherwise
obtained a wide circulation, and, excelling in point of
illustration every production that had yet appeared in
America, gained for the author universal commendation.
In January 1810, his second volume appeared, and in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
month after he proceeded to Pittsburg, and from thence,
in a small skiff, made a solitary voyage down the Ohio,
a distance of nearly six hundred miles. During this
lonely and venturous journey he experienced relaxation
in the composition of a poem, which afterwards appeared
under the title of "The Pilgrim." In 1813, after encountering
numerous hardships and perils, which an
enthusiast only could have endured, he completed the
publication of the seventh volume of his great work.
But the sedulous attention requisite in the preparation
of the plates of the eighth volume, and the effect of a
severe cold, caught in rashly throwing himself into a
river to swim in pursuit of a rare bird, brought on him
a fatal dysentery, which carried him off, on the 23d of
August 1813, in his forty-eighth year. He was interred
in the cemetery of the Swedish church, Southwark,
Philadelphia, where a plain marble monument has been
erected to his memory. A ninth volume was added to
the "Ornithology" by Mr George Ord, an intimate friend
of the deceased naturalist; and three supplementary
volumes have been published, in folio, by Charles Lucien
Bonaparte, uncle of the present Emperor of the French.</p>

<p>Amidst his extraordinary deserts as a naturalist, the
merits of Alexander Wilson as a poet have been somewhat
overlooked. His poetry, it may be remarked,
though unambitious of ornament, is bold and vigorous
in style, and, when devoted to satire, is keen and vehement.
The ballad of "Watty and Meg," though exception
may be taken to the moral, is an admirable
picture of human nature, and one of the most graphic
narratives of the "taming of a shrew" in the language.
Allan Cunningham writes: "It has been excelled by
none in lively, graphic fidelity of touch: whatever was
present to his eye and manifest to his ear, he could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
paint with a life and a humour which Burns seems alone
to excel."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> In private life, Wilson was a model of
benevolence and of the social virtues; he was devoid
of selfishness, active in beneficence, and incapable of
resentment. Before his departure for America, he waited
on every one whom he conceived he had offended by
his juvenile escapades, and begged their forgiveness;
and he did not hesitate to reprove Burns for the levity
too apparent in some of his poems. To his aged father,
who survived till the year 1816, he sent remittances of
money as often as he could afford; and at much inconvenience
and pecuniary sacrifice, he established the
family of his brother-in-law on a farm in the States.
He was sober even to abstinence; and was guided in
all his transactions by correct Christian principles. In
person, he was remarkably handsome; his countenance
was intelligent, and his eye sparkling. He never
attained riches, but few Scotsmen have left more splendid
memorials of their indomitable perseverance.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CAROLINA_BARONESS_NAIRN" id="CAROLINA_BARONESS_NAIRN"></a>CAROLINA, BARONESS NAIRN.</h2>


<p>Carolina Oliphant was born in the old mansion of
Gask, in the county of Perth, on the 16th of July 1766.
She was the third daughter and fifth child of Laurence
Oliphant of Gask, who had espoused his cousin Margaret
Robertson, a daughter of Duncan Robertson of Struan,
and his wife a daughter of the fourth Lord Nairn.
The Oliphants of Gask were cadets of the formerly
noble house of Oliphant; whose ancestor, Sir William
Oliphant of Aberdalgie, a puissant knight, acquired distinction
in the beginning of the fourteenth century by
defending the Castle of Stirling against a formidable
siege by the first Edward. The family of Gask were
devoted Jacobites; the paternal grandfather of Carolina
Oliphant had attended Prince Charles Edward as aid-de-camp
during his disastrous campaign of 1745-6, and
his spouse had indicated her sympathy in his cause by
cutting out a lock of his hair on the occasion of his accepting
the hospitality of the family mansion. The portion
of hair is preserved at Gask; and Carolina Oliphant,
in her song, "The Auld House," has thus celebrated
the gentle deed of her progenitor:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Leddy too, sae genty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There shelter'd Scotland's heir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' clipt a lock wi' her ain hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frae his lang yellow hair."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></div></div>

<p>The estate of Gask escaped forfeiture, but the father of
Carolina did not renounce the Jacobite sentiments of
his ancestors. He named the subject of this memoir
Carolina, in honour of Prince Charles Edward; and his
prevailing topic of conversation was the reiterated expression
of his hope that "the king would get his ain."
He would not permit the names of the reigning monarch
and his queen to be mentioned in his presence; and
when impaired eyesight compelled him to seek the
assistance of his family in reading the newspapers, he
angrily reproved the reader if the "German lairdie and
his leddy" were designated otherwise than by the initial
letters, "K. and Q." This extreme Jacobitism at a
period when the crime was scarcely to be dreaded, was
reported to George III., who is related to have confessed
his respect for a man who had so consistently maintained
his political sentiments.</p>

<p>In her youth, Carolina Oliphant was singularly beautiful,
and was known in her native district by the
poetical designation of "The Flower of Strathearn."
She was as remarkable for the precocity of her intellect,
as she was celebrated for the elegance of her person.
Descended by her mother from a family which, in one
instance,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> at least, had afforded some evidence of poetical
talents, and possessed of a correct musical ear, she
very early composed verses for her favourite melodies.
To the development of her native genius, her juvenile
condition abundantly contributed: the locality of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
birthplace, rich in landscape scenery, and associated
with family traditions and legends of curious and chivalric
adventure, might have been sufficient to promote,
in a mind less fertile than her own, sentiments of poesy.
In the application of her talents she was influenced by
another incentive. A loose ribaldry tainted the songs
and ballads which circulated among the peasantry, and
she was convinced that the diffusion of a more wholesome
minstrelsy would essentially elevate the moral
tone of the community. Thus, while still young, she
commenced to purify the older melodies, and to compose
new songs, which were ultimately destined to occupy
an ample share of the national heart. The occasion of
an agricultural dinner in the neighbourhood afforded
her a fitting opportunity of making trial of her success
in the good work which she had begun. To the president
of the meeting she sent, anonymously, her verses
entitled "The Ploughman;" and the production being
publicly read, was received with warm approbation, and
was speedily put to music. She was thus encouraged
to proceed in her self-imposed task; and to this early
period of her life may be ascribed some of her best
lyrics. "The Laird o' Cockpen," and "The Land o'
the Leal," at the close of the century, were sung in
every district of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Carolina Oliphant had many suitors for her hand:
she gave a preference to William Murray Nairn, her
maternal cousin, who had been Baron Nairn, barring
the attainder of the title on account of the Jacobitism
of the last Baron. The marriage was celebrated
in June 1806. At this period, Mr Nairn was Assistant
Inspector-General of Barracks in Scotland,
and held the rank of major in the army. By Act of
Parliament, on the 17th June 1824, the attainder of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
the family was removed, the title of Baron being conferred
on Major Nairn. This measure is reported to
have been passed on the strong recommendation of
George IV.; his Majesty having learned, during his state
visit to Scotland in 1822, that the song of "The Attainted
Scottish Nobles" was the composition of Lady
Nairn. The song is certainly one of the best apologies
for Jacobitism.</p>

<p>On the 9th of July 1830, Lady Nairn was bereaved
of her husband, to whom she had proved an affectionate
wife. Her care had for several years been assiduously
bestowed on the proper rearing of her only child
William, who, being born in 1808, had reached his
twenty-second year when he succeeded to the title on
the death of his father. This young nobleman warmly
reciprocated his mother's affectionate devotedness; and,
making her the associate of his manhood, proved a
source of much comfort to her in her bereavement.
In 1837, he resolved, in her society, to visit the
Continent, in the hope of being recruited by change of
climate from an attack of influenza caught in the
spring of that year. But the change did not avail;
he was seized with a violent cold at Brussels, which,
after an illness of six weeks, proved fatal. He died
in that city on the 7th of December 1837. Deprived
both of her husband and her only child, a young
nobleman of so much promise, and of singular Christian
worth, Lady Nairn, though submitting to the
mysterious dispensations with becoming resignation,
did not regain her wonted buoyancy of spirit. Old
age was rapidly approaching,&mdash;those years in which the
words of the inspired sage, "I have no pleasure in
them," are too frequently called forth by the pressure of
human infirmities. But this amiable lady did not sink<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
under the load of affliction and of years: she mourned
in hope, and wept in faith. While the afflictions which
had mingled with her cup of blessings tended to prevent
her lingering too intently on the past,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> the remembrance
of a life devoted to deeds of piety and virtue was a solace
greater than any other earthly object could impart, leading
her to hail the future with sentiments of joyful
anticipation. During the last years of her life, unfettered
by worldly ties, she devoted all her energies to the
service of Heaven, and to the advancement of Christian
truth. Her beautiful ode, "Would you be young again?"
was composed in 1842, and enclosed in a letter to a
friend; it is signally expressive of the pious resignation
and Christian hope of the author.</p>

<p>After the important era of her marriage, she seems
to have relinquished her literary ardour. But in the
year 1821, Mr Robert Purdie, an enterprising music-seller
in Edinburgh, having resolved to publish a series
of the more approved national songs, made application
to several ladies celebrated for their musical skill, with
the view of obtaining their assistance in the arrangement
of the melodies. To these ladies was known the
secret of Lady Nairn's devotedness to Scottish song,
enjoying as they did her literary correspondence and
private intimacy; and in consenting to aid the publisher
in his undertaking, they calculated on contributions
from their accomplished friend. They had formed a
correct estimate: Lady Nairn, whose extreme diffidence
had hitherto proved a barrier to the fulfilment of the
best wishes of her heart, in effecting the reformation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
the national minstrelsy, consented to transmit pieces for
insertion, on the express condition that her name and
rank, and every circumstance connected with her history,
should be kept in profound secrecy. The condition
was carefully observed; so that, although the
publication of "The Scottish Minstrel" extended over
three years, and she had several personal interviews and
much correspondence with the publisher and his editor,
Mr R. A. Smith, both these individuals remained ignorant
of her real name. She had assumed the signature,
"B. B.," in her correspondence with Mr Purdie, who
appears to have been entertained by <i>the discovery</i>, communicated
in confidence, that the name of his contributor
was "Mrs Bogan of Bogan;" and by this designation
he subsequently addressed her. The <i>nom de
guerre</i> of the two B.'s<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> is attached to the greater number
of Lady Nairn's contributions in "The Scottish Minstrel."</p>

<p>The new collection of minstrelsy, unexceptionable as
it was in the words attached to all the airs, commanded
a wide circulation, and excited general attention. The
original contributions were especially commended, and
some of them were forthwith sung by professed vocalists
in the principal towns. Much speculation arose respecting
the authorship, and various conjectures were supported,
each with plausible arguments, by the public
journalists. In these circumstances, Lady Nairn expe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>rienced
painful alarm, lest, by any inadvertence on the
part of her friends, the origin of her songs should be
traced. While the publication of the "Minstrel" was
proceeding, her correspondents received repeated injunctions
to adopt every caution in preserving her <i>incognita</i>;
she was even desirous that her sex might not be made
known. "I beg the publisher will make no mention of
a <i>lady</i>," she wrote to one of her correspondents, "as you
observe, the more mystery the better, and <i>still</i> the
balance is in favour of the lords of creation. I cannot
help, in some degree, undervaluing beforehand what is
said to be a feminine production." "The Scottish
Minstrel" was completed in 1824, in six royal octavo
volumes, forming one of the best collections of the Scottish
melodies. It was in the full belief that "Mrs
Bogan" was her real name, that the following compliment
was paid to Lady Nairn by Messrs Purdie and R.
A. Smith, in the advertisement to the last volume of the
work:&mdash;"In particular, the editors would have felt
happy in being permitted to enumerate the many original
and beautiful verses that adorn their pages, for
which they are indebted to the author of the much-admired
song, 'The Land o' the Leal;' but they fear to
wound a delicacy which shrinks from all observation."</p>

<p>Subsequent to the appearance of "The Scottish
Minstrel," Lady Nairn did not publish any lyrics; and
she was eminently successful in preserving her <i>incognita</i>.
No critic ventured to identify her as the celebrated
"B. B.," and it was only whispered among a few that
she had composed "The Land o' the Leal." The mention
of her name publicly as the author of this beautiful
ode, on one occasion, had signally disconcerted her.
While she was resident in Paris, in 1842, she writes to
an intimate friend in Edinburgh on this subject:&mdash;"A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
Scottish lady here, Lady&mdash;&mdash;, with whom I never met
in Scotland, is so good as, among perfect strangers,
to <i>denounce</i> me as the origin of 'The Land o' the
Leal!' I cannot trace it, but very much dislike as ever
any kind of publicity." The extreme diffidence and
shrinking modesty of the amiable author continued to
the close of her life; she never divulged, beyond a small
circle of confidential friends, the authorship of a single
verse. The songs published in her youth had been
given to others; but, as in the case of Lady Anne Barnard,
these assignments caused her no uneasiness. She
experienced much gratification in finding her simple
minstrelsy supplanting the coarse and demoralising
rhymes of a former period; and this mental satisfaction
she preferred to fame.</p>

<p>The philanthropic efforts of Lady Nairn were not
limited to the purification of the national minstrelsy;
her benevolence extended towards the support of every
institution likely to promote the temporal comforts, or
advance the spiritual interests of her countrymen. Her
contributions to the public charities were ample, and she</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Did good by stealth, and blush'd to find it fame."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In an address delivered at Edinburgh, on the 29th of
December 1845, Dr Chalmers, referring to the exertions
which had been made for the supply of religious instruction
in the district of the West Port of Edinburgh, made
the following remarks regarding Lady Nairn, who was
then recently deceased:&mdash;"Let me speak now as to the
countenance we have received. I am now at liberty to
mention a very noble benefaction which I received about
a year ago. Inquiry was made at me by a lady, mentioning
that she had a sum at her disposal, and that she
wished to apply it to charitable purposes; and she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
wanted me to enumerate a list of charitable objects, in
proportion to the estimate I had of their value. Accordingly,
I furnished her with a scale of about five or six
charitable objects. The highest in the scale were those
institutions which had for their design the Christianising
of the people at home; and I also mentioned to her,
in connexion with the Christianising at home, what we
were doing at the West Port; and there came to me
from her, in the course of a day or two, no less a sum
than &pound;300. She is now dead; she is now in her grave,
and her works do follow her. When she gave me this
noble benefaction, she laid me under strict injunctions of
secrecy, and, accordingly, I did not mention her name
to any person; but after she was dead, I begged of her
nearest heir that I might be allowed to proclaim it, because
I thought that her example, so worthy to be followed,
might influence others in imitating her; and I am
happy to say that I am now at liberty to state that it was
Lady Nairn of Perthshire. It enabled us, at the expense
of &pound;330, to purchase sites for schools, and a church; and
we have got a site in the very heart of the locality,
with a very considerable extent of ground for a washing-green,
a washing-house, and a play-ground for the children,
so that we are a good step in advance towards the
completion of our parochial economy."</p>

<p>After the death of her son, and till within two years
of her own death, Lady Nairn resided chiefly on the
Continent, and frequently in Paris. Her health had for
several years been considerably impaired, and latterly
she had recourse to a wheeled chair. In the mansion of
Gask, on the 27th of October 1845, she gently sunk
into her rest, at the advanced age of seventy-nine years.</p>

<p>Some years subsequent to this event, it occurred to the
relatives and literary friends of the deceased Baroness that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
as there could no longer be any reason for retaining her
<i>incognita</i>, full justice should be done to her memory by
the publication of a collected edition of her works. This
scheme was partially executed in an elegant folio, entitled
"Lays from Strathearn: by Carolina, Baroness
Nairn. Arranged with Symphonies and Accompaniments
for the Pianoforte, by Finlay Dun." It bears the
imprint of London, and has no date. In this work, of
which a new edition will speedily be published by Messrs
Paterson, music-sellers, Edinburgh, are contained seventy
songs, but the larger proportion of the author's lyrics
still remain in MS. From her representatives we have
received permission to select her best lyrics for the
present work, and to insert several pieces hitherto unpublished.
Of the lays which we have selected, several
are new versions to old airs; the majority, though
unknown as the compositions of Lady Nairn, are already
familiar in the drawing-room and the cottage. For
winning simplicity, graceful expression, and exquisite
pathos, her compositions are especially remarkable; but
when her muse prompts to humour, the laugh is
sprightly and overpowering.</p>

<p>In society, Lady Nairn was reserved and unassuming.
Her countenance, naturally beautiful, wore, in her mature
years, a somewhat pensive cast; and the characteristic
by which she was known consisted in her enthusiastic
love of music. It may be added, that she was fond
of the fine arts, and was skilled in the use of the pencil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="JAMES_NICOL" id="JAMES_NICOL"></a>JAMES NICOL.</h2>


<p>James Nicol, the son of Michael Nicol and Marion
Hope, was born at Innerleithen, in the county of
Peebles, on the 28th of September 1769. Having
acquired the elements of classical knowledge under Mr
Tate, the parochial schoolmaster, he was sent to the
University of Edinburgh, where he pursued study with
unflinching assiduity and success. On completing his
academical studies, he was licensed as a probationer by
the Presbytery of Peebles. His first professional employment
was as an assistant to the minister of Traquair,
a parish bordering on that of Innerleithen; and on the
death of the incumbent, Mr Nicol succeeded to the
living. On the 4th of November 1802, he was ordained
to the ministerial office; and on the 25th of the same
month and year, he espoused Agnes Walker, a native of
Glasgow, and the sister of his immediate predecessor,
who had for a considerable period possessed a warm
place in his affections, and been the heroine of his poetical
reveries. He had for some time been in the habit of
communicating verses to the <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i>; and
he afterwards published a collection of "Poems, chiefly in
the Scottish Dialect," Edinburgh, 1805, 2 vols. 12mo.
This publication, which was well received, contains some
lyrical effusions that entitle the author to a respectable
rank among the modern cultivators of national poetry;
yet it is to be regretted that a deep admiration of
Burns has led him into an imitation, somewhat servile,
of that immortal bard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>At Traquair Mr Nicol continued to devote himself to
mental improvement. He read extensively; and writing
upon the subject of his studies was his daily habit.
He was never robust, being affected with a chronic disorder
of the stomach; and when sickness prevented
him, as occasionally happened, from writing in a sitting
posture, he would for hours together have devoted himself
to composition in a standing position. Of his prose
writings, which were numerous, the greater number still
remain in MS., in the possession of his elder son. During
his lifetime, he contributed a number of articles to
the <i>Edinburgh Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>, among which are "Baptism,"
"Baptistry," "Baptists," "Bithynia," and
"Cranmer." His posthumous work, "An Essay on
the Nature and Design of Scripture Sacrifices," was
published in an octavo volume in the year 1823.</p>

<p>Mr Nicol was much respected for his sound discernment
in matters of business, as well as for his benevolent disposition.
Every dispute in the vicinity was submitted
to his adjudication, and his counsel checked all differences
in the district. He was regularly consulted as a
physician, for he had studied medicine at the University.
From his own medicine chest he dispensed gratuitously
to the indigent sick; and without fee he vaccinated
all the children of the neighbourhood who were
brought to him. After a short illness, he died on the
5th of November 1819. Of a family of three sons and
three daughters, the eldest son predeceased him; two
sons and two daughters still survive. The elder son, who
bears his father's Christian name, is Professor of Civil
and Natural History in Marischal College, Aberdeen,
and is well known as a geologist. Mrs Nicol survived
her husband till the 19th of March 1845.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="JAMES_MONTGOMERY" id="JAMES_MONTGOMERY"></a>JAMES MONTGOMERY.</h2>


<p>James Montgomery, the spiritual character of whose
writings has gained him the honourable designation of
the Christian Poet, was born at Irvine, in the county of
Ayr, on the 4th of November 1771. His father, John
Montgomery, was a missionary of the Moravian Brethren,
and in this capacity came to Irvine from Ireland,
only a few days before the birth of James, his eldest
son. In his fourth year he returned to Ireland with his
parents, and received the rudiments of his education
from the village schoolmaster of Grace Hill, a settlement
of the Moravian Brethren in the county of Antrim.
In October 1777, in his seventh year, he was placed by
his father in the seminary of the Moravian settlement of
Fulneck, near Leeds; and on the departure of his parents
to the West Indies, in 1783, he was committed to the care
of the Brethren, with the view of his being trained for
their Church. He was not destined to see his parents
again. His mother died at Barbadoes, in November
1790, and his father after an interval of eight months.</p>

<p>In consequence of his indolent habits, which were incorrigible,
young Montgomery was removed from the
seminary at Fulneck, and placed in the shop of a
baker at Mirfield, in the vicinity. He was then in his
sixteenth year; and having already afforded evidence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
of a refined taste, both in poetry and music, though
careless of the ordinary routine of scholastic instruction,
his new occupation was altogether uncongenial to his
feelings. He, however, remained about eighteen months
in the baker's service, but at length made a hasty
escape from Mirfield, with only three shillings and sixpence
in his pocket, and seemingly without any scheme
except that of relieving himself from an irksome employment.
But an accidental circumstance speedily enabled
him to obtain an engagement with a shopkeeper in
Wath, now a station on the railway between London
and Leeds; and in procuring this employment, he was
indebted to the recommendation of his former master,
whose service he had unceremoniously quitted. But this
new situation had few advantages over the old, and he
relinquished it in about a year to try his fortune in the
metropolis. He had previously sent a manuscript volume
of poetry to Harrison, the bookseller of Paternoster
Row, who, while declining to publish it, commended
the author's talents, and so far promoted his views as
now to receive him into his establishment. But Montgomery's
aspirations had no reference to serving behind
a counter; he only accepted a place in the bookseller's
establishment that he might have an opportunity of
leisurely feeling his way as an author. His literary
efforts, however, still proved fruitless. He composed
essays and tales, and wrote a romance in the manner of
Fielding, but none of his productions could find a
publisher. Mortified by his failures, he quitted London
in eight months, and returned to the shop of his former
employer at Wath. After the interval of another year,
he proceeded to Sheffield, to occupy a situation under
Mr Joseph Gales, a bookseller, and the proprietor of
the <i>Register</i> newspaper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>Montgomery was now in his twenty-first year, and
fortune at length began, though with many lowering
intervals, to smile upon his youthful aspirations. Though
he occupied a subordinate post in Mr Gales' establishment,
his literary services were accepted for the <i>Register</i>,
in which he published many of his earlier compositions,
both in prose and verse. This journal had advocated
sentiments of an ultra-liberal order, and commanding a
wide circulation and a powerful influence among the
operatives in Sheffield, had been narrowly inspected by
the authorities. At length the proprietor fell into the
snare of sympathising in the transactions of the French
revolutionists; he was prosecuted for sedition, and
deemed himself only safe from compulsory exile by a
voluntary exit to America. This event took place
about two years after Montgomery's first connexion with
Sheffield, and he had now reverted to his former condition
of abject dependence unless for a fortunate occurrence.
This was no less than his being appointed joint-proprietor
and editor of the newspaper by a wealthy individual,
who, noticing the abilities of the young shopman,
purchased the copyright with the view of placing
the management entirely in his hands.</p>

<p>The first number of the newspaper under the poet's
care, the name being changed to that of <i>The Sheffield
Iris</i>, appeared in July 1794; and though the principles
of the journal were moderate and conciliatory in comparison
with the democratic sentiments espoused by the
former publisher, the jealous eye of the authorities rested
on its new conductor. He did not escape their vigilance;
for the simple offence of printing for a ballad-vender
some verses of a song celebrating the fall of the
Bastile, he was libelled as "a wicked, malicious, seditious,
and evil-disposed person;" and being tried before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
the Doncaster Quarter Sessions, in January 1795, was sentenced
to three months' imprisonment in the Castle of
York. He was condemned to a second imprisonment of
six months in the autumn of the same year, for inserting
in his paper an account of a riot in the place, in which he
was considered to have cast aspersions on a colonel of
volunteers. The calm mind of the poet did not sink
under these persecutions, and some of his best lyrics
were composed during the period of his latter confinement.
During his first detention he wrote a series of
interesting essays for his newspaper. His "Prison
Amusements," a series of beautiful pieces, appeared in
1797. In 1805, he published his poem, "The Ocean;"
in 1806, "The Wanderer in Switzerland;" in 1808,
"The West Indies;" and in 1812, "The World before
the Flood." In 1819 he published "Greenland, a
Poem, in Five Cantos;" and in 1825 appeared "The
Pelican Island, and other Poems." Of all those productions,
"The Wanderer in Switzerland" attained the
widest circulation; and, notwithstanding an unfavourable
and injudicious criticism in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>,
at once procured an honourable place for the author
among his contemporaries. He became sole proprietor
of the <i>Iris</i> in one year after his being connected with it,
and he continued to conduct this paper till September
1825, when he retired from public duty. He subsequently
contributed articles for different periodicals;
but he chiefly devoted himself to the moral and religious
improvement of his fellow-townsmen. A pension of
&pound;150 on the civil list was conferred upon him as an acknowledgment
of his services in behalf of literature
and of philanthropy; a well-merited public boon which
for many years he was spared to enjoy. He died at his
residence, The Mount, Sheffield, on the 30th of April<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
1854, in the eighty-second year of his age. He bequeathed
handsome legacies to various public charities.
His Poetical Works, in a collected form, were published
in 1850 by the Messrs Longman, in one octavo volume;
and in 1853 he gave to the world his last work, being
"Original Hymns, for Public, Private, and Social Devotion."
Copious memoirs of his life are now in the
course of publication.</p>

<p>As a poet, Montgomery is conspicuous for the smoothness
of his versification, and for the fervent piety pervading
all his compositions. As a man, he was gentle
and conciliatory, and was remarkable as a generous
promoter of benevolent institutions. The general tendency
of his poems was thus indicated by himself, in the
course of an address which he made at a public dinner,
given him at Sheffield, in November 1825, immediately
after the toast of his health being proposed by the chairman,
Lord Viscount Milton, now Earl Fitzwilliam:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I sang of war&mdash;but it was the war of freedom, in which death
was preferred to chains. I sang the abolition of the slave trade,
that most glorious decree of the British Legislature at any period
since the Revolution, by the first Parliament in which you, my
Lord, sat as the representative of Yorkshire. Oh, how should I
rejoice to sing the abolition of slavery itself by some Parliament
of which your Lordship shall yet be a member! This greater act
of righteous legislation is surely not too remote to be expected
even in our own day. Renouncing the slave trade was only
'ceasing to do evil;' extinguishing slavery will be 'learning to
do well.' Again, I sang of love&mdash;the love of country, the love of
my own country; for,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Land of my fathers! thee I love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, rail thy slanderers as they will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all thy faults I love thee still.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I sang, likewise, the love of home&mdash;its charities, endearments
and relationships&mdash;all that makes 'Home sweet Home,' the recol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>lection
of which, when the air of that name was just now played
from yonder gallery, warmed every heart throughout this room
into quicker pulsations. I sang the love which man ought to bear
towards his brother, of every kindred, and country, and clime
upon earth. I sang the love of virtue, which elevates man to his
true standard under heaven. I sang, too, the love of God, who <i>is</i>
love. Nor did I sing in vain. I found readers and listeners,
especially among the young, the fair, and the devout; and as
youth, beauty, and piety will not soon cease out of the land, I
may expect to be remembered through another generation at
least, if I leave anything behind me worthy of remembrance.
I may add that, from every part of the British empire, from every
quarter of the world where our language is spoken&mdash;from America,
the East and West Indies, from New Holland, and the South Sea
Islands themselves&mdash;I have received testimonies of approbation
from all ranks and degrees of readers, hailing what I had done, and
cheering me forward. I allude not to criticisms and eulogiums from
the press, but to voluntary communications from unknown correspondents,
coming to me like voices out of darkness, and giving
intimation of that which the ear of a poet is always hearkening
onward to catch&mdash;the voice of posterity."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="ANDREW_SCOTT" id="ANDREW_SCOTT"></a>ANDREW SCOTT.</h2>


<p>Andrew Scott, known as the author of the popular
ballad of "Symon and Janet," has claims to a wider
reputation. He was born of humble parentage, in the
parish of Bowden, Roxburghshire, in the year 1757.
He was early employed as a cowherd; and he has recorded,
in a sketch of his own life prefixed to one of
his volumes, that he began to compose verses on the
hill-sides in his twelfth year. He ascribes this juvenile
predilection to the perusal of Ramsay's "Gentle Shepherd,"
a pamphlet copy of which he had purchased with
some spare halfpence. Towards the close of the American
war, he joined the army as a recruit, and soon
thereafter followed his regiment across the Atlantic.
His rhyming propensities continued; and he occupied
his leisure hours in composing verses, which he read for
the amusement of his comrades. At the conclusion of
the American campaigns, he returned with the army to
Britain; and afterwards procuring his discharge, he
made a settlement in his native parish. For the period
of seventeen years, according to his own narrative, he
abandoned the cultivation of poetry, assiduously applying
himself to manual labour for the support of his
family. An intelligent acquaintance, who had procured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
copies of some of his verses, now recommended him to
attempt a publication&mdash;a counsel which induced him to
print a small volume by subscription. This appeared
in 1805, and was reprinted, with several additions, in
1808. In 1811 he published "Poems, chiefly in the
Scottish Dialect," Kelso, 18mo; another duodecimo
volume of poems, at Jedburgh, in 1821; and his last
work, entitled "Poems on Various Subjects," at Edinburgh,
in 1826. This last volume was inscribed, with
permission, to the Duchess of Roxburghe.</p>

<p>The poet's social condition at Bowden was little
favourable to the composition of poetry. Situated on
the south side of the Eildon hills, the parish is entirely
separated from the busy world, and the inhabitants were
formerly proverbial for their rustic simplicity and ignorance.
The encouragement desiderated at home, the poet,
however, experienced elsewhere. He visited Melrose, at
the easy distance of two miles, on the day of the weekly
market, and there met with friends and patrons from
different parts of the district. The late Duke of Roxburghe,
Sir Walter Scott, Mr Baillie of Jerviswoode, Mr
John Gibson Lockhart, and Mr G. P. R. James, the
novelist, who sometimes resided in the neighbourhood,
and other persons of rank or literary eminence, extended
towards him countenance and assistance.</p>

<p>Scott shared the indigent lot of poets. He remained
in the condition of an agricultural labourer, and for
many years held the office of beadle, or church-officer,
of the parish. He died on the 22d of May 1839, in the
eighty-second year of his age; and his remains were
interred in the churchyard of Bowden, where his name
is inscribed on a gravestone which he had erected to
the memory of his wife. His eldest son holds the office
of schoolmaster of that parish.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>The personal appearance of the bard appears to have
been prepossessing: his countenance wore a highly intellectual
aspect. Subsequent to the publication of the
first volume of his poems, he was requested to sit for his
portrait by the late Mr George Watson, the well-known
portrait-painter; and who was so well satisfied with
the excellence of his subject, that he exhibited the
portrait for a lengthened period in his studio. It is
now in the possession of the author's son at Bowden,
and has been pronounced a masterpiece of art. A badly
executed engraving from it is prefixed to Scott's last
two volumes. In manner, the poet was modest and
unassuming, and his utterance was slow and defective.
The songs selected for this work may be regarded as
the most favourable specimens of his muse.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="SIR_WALTER_SCOTT_BART" id="SIR_WALTER_SCOTT_BART"></a>SIR WALTER SCOTT, BART.</h2>


<p>Sir Walter Scott, the most chivalrous of Scottish
poets, and the most illustrious of British novelists, was
born in Edinburgh, on the 15th of August 1771. His
father, Walter Scott, Writer to the Signet, was descended
from a younger branch of the baronial house of
the Scotts of Harden, of which Lord Polwarth is the
present representative. On his mother's side his progenitors
were likewise highly respectable: his maternal
grandfather, Dr John Rutherford, was Professor of the
Practice of Physic in the University of Edinburgh, and
his mother's brother, Dr Daniel Rutherford, an eminent
chemist, afterwards occupied the chair of Botany. His
mother was a person of a vigorous and cultivated mind.
Of a family of twelve children, born to his parents, six
of whom survived infancy, Walter only evinced the
possession of the uncommon attribute of genius. He
was born a healthy child, but soon after became exposed
to serious peril by being some time tended by a consumptive
nurse. When scarcely two years old he was
seized with an illness which deprived him of the proper
use of his right limb, a loss which continued during his
life. With the view of retrieving his strength, he was
sent to reside with his paternal grandfather, Robert<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
Scott, who rented the farm of Sandyknowe, in the vicinity
of Smailholm Tower, in Roxburghshire. Shortly
after his arrival at Sandyknowe, he narrowly escaped
destruction through the frantic desperation of a maniac
attendant; but he had afterwards to congratulate himself
on being enabled to form an early acquaintance with
rural scenes. No advantage accruing to his lameness,
he was, in his fourth year, removed to Bath, where he
remained twelve months, without experiencing benefit
from the mineral waters. During the three following
years he chiefly resided at Sandyknowe. In his eighth
year he returned to Edinburgh, with his mind largely
stored with border legends, chiefly derived from the recitations
of his grandmother, a person of a romantic inclination
and sprightly intelligence. At this period,
Pope's translation of Homer, and the more amusing songs
in Ramsay's "Evergreen," were his favourite studies;
and he took delight in reading aloud, with suitable
emphasis, the more striking passages, or verses, to his
mother, who sought every incentive to stimulate his
native propensity. In 1778 he was sent to the High
School, where he possessed the advantage of instruction
under Mr Luke Fraser, an able scholar, and Dr Adam,
the distinguished rector. His progress in scholarship
was not equal to his talents; he was already a devotee
to romance, and experienced greater gratification in retiring
with a friend to some quiet spot in the country,
to relate or to listen to a fictitious tale, than in giving
his principal attention to the prescribed tasks of the
schoolroom. As he became older, the love of miscellaneous
literature, especially the works of the great masters
of fiction, amounted to a passion; and as his memory
was singularly tenacious, he accumulated a great extent
and variety of miscellaneous information.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>On the completion of his attendance at the High
School, he was sent to reside with some relations at
Kelso; and in this interesting locality his growing attachment
to the national minstrelsy and legendary lore
received a fresh impulse. On his return to Edinburgh
he entered the University, in which he matriculated as a
student of Latin and Greek, in October 1793. His progress
was not more marked than it had been at the
High School, insomuch that Mr Dalziel, the professor
of Greek, was induced to give public expression as to
his hopeless incapacity. The professor fortunately survived
to make ample compensation for the rashness of
his prediction.</p>

<p>The juvenile inclinations of the future poet were entirely
directed to a military life; but his continued
lameness interposed an insuperable difficulty, and was
a source of deep mortification. He was at length induced
to adopt a profession suitable to his physical
capabilities, entering into indentures with his father in
his fourteenth year. To his confinement at the desk,
sufficiently irksome to a youth of his aspirations, he was
chiefly reconciled by the consideration that his fees as a
clerk enabled him to purchase books.</p>

<p>Rapid growth in a constitution which continued delicate
till he had attained his fifteenth year, led to his
bursting a blood-vessel in the second year of his apprenticeship.
While precluded from active duty, being
closely confined to bed, and not allowed to exert himself
by speaking, he was still allowed to read; a privilege
which accelerated his acquaintance with general
literature. To complete his recovery, he was recommended
exercise on horseback; and in obeying the instructions
of his physician, he gratified his own peculiar
tastes by making himself generally familiar with locali<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>ties
and scenes famous in Scottish story. On the restoration
of his health, he at length became seriously engaged
in the study of law for several continuous years,
and, after the requisite examinations, was admitted as an
advocate, on the 10th of July 1792, when on the point
of attaining his twenty-first year.</p>

<p>In his twelfth year, Scott had composed some verses
for his preceptor and early friend Dr Adam, which
afforded promise of his future excellence. But he seems
not to have extensively indulged, in early life, in the
composition of poetry, while his juvenile productions in
prose wore a stiff formality. On being called to the
bar, he at first carefully refrained, according to his own
statement, from claiming the honour of authorship, lest
his brethren or the public should suppose that his habits
were unsuitable to a due attention to the duties of his
profession. He was relieved of dependence on professional
employment by espousing, in December 1797,
Miss Carpenter, a young French gentlewoman, possessed
of a considerable annuity, whose acquaintance he had
formed at Gilsland, a watering-place in Cumberland.
In 1800 he was appointed Sheriff of Selkirkshire, with
a salary of &pound;300 a year. While he continued in his
father's office he had made himself familiar with the
French and Italian languages, and had read many of
their more celebrated authors, especially the writings of
Tasso and Ariosto. Some years after he came to the
bar, he was induced to acquaint himself with the ballad
poetry of Germany, then in vogue, through the translations
of Mr Lewis, whose friendship he had recently
acquired. In 1796 he made his first adventure as an
author by publishing translations of "Lenor&eacute;," and
"The Wild Huntsman" of B&uuml;rger. The attempt proved
unsuccessful; but, undismayed, he again essayed his skill<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
in translation by publishing, in 1799, an English version
of Go&euml;the's "Goetz of Berlichingen." His success as an
author was, however, destined to rest on original performances,
illustrative of the chivalry of his own land.</p>

<p>Towards the recovery and publication of the ancient
ballads and songs of the Scottish borders, which had
only been preserved by the recitations of the peasantry,
Scott had early formed important intentions. The independence
of his circumstances now enabled him to
execute his long-cherished scheme. He made periodical
excursions into Liddesdale, a wild pastoral district on
the Scottish border, anciently peopled by the noted
Elliots and Armstrongs, in quest of old ballads and traditions;
and the fruits of his research, along with much
curious information, partly communicated to him by
intelligent correspondents, he gave to the world, in
1802, in two volumes octavo, under the title of "Minstrelsy
of the Scottish Border." He added in the following
year a third volume, consisting of imitations of
ancient ballads, composed by himself and others. These
volumes issued from the printing-press of his early friend
and school-fellow, Mr James Ballantyne of Kelso, who
had already begun to indicate that skill in typography for
which he was afterwards so justly celebrated. In 1804
he published, from the Auchinleck Manuscript in the
Advocates' Library, the ancient metrical tale of "Sir
Tristrem;" and, in an elaborate introduction, he endeavoured
to prove that it was the composition of
Thomas of Ercildoune, better known as Thomas the
Rhymer. He published in 1805 "The Lay of the
Last Minstrel," an original ballad poem, which, speedily
attaining a wide circulation, procured for him an extensive
reputation, and the substantial reward of &pound;600.</p>

<p>The prosperity of the poet rose with his fame. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
the year following that which produced the "Lay,"
he received his appointment as a principal clerk of the
Court of Session, an office which afterwards brought him
&pound;1200 a-year. To literary occupation he now resolved
to dedicate his intervals of leisure. In 1808 he produced
"Marmion," his second great poem, which
brought him &pound;1000 from the publisher, and at once
established his fame. During the same year he
completed the heavy task of editing the works of
Dryden, in eighteen volumes. In 1809 he edited the
state papers and letters of Sir Ralph Sadler, and became
a contributor to the <i>Edinburgh Annual Register</i>,
conducted by Southey. "The Lady of the Lake," the
most happily-conceived and popular of his poetical
works, appeared in 1810; "Don Roderick," in 1811;
"Rokeby," in 1813; and "The Lord of the Isles," in
1814. "Harold the Dauntless," and "The Bridal of
Triermain," appeared subsequently, without the author's
name.</p>

<p>As a poet, Scott had now attained a celebrity unrivalled
among his contemporaries, and it was in the
apprehension of compromising his reputation, that, in
attempting a new species of composition, he was extremely
anxious to conceal the name of the author.
The novel of "Waverley," which appeared in 1814, did
not, however, suffer from its being anonymous; for,
although the sale was somewhat heavy at first, the work
soon afterwards reached the extraordinary circulation of
twelve thousand copies. Contrary to reasonable expectation,
however, the author of "Waverley" did not
avow himself, and, numerous as was the catalogue of
prose fictions which, for more than twenty years, proceeded
from his pen, he continued as desirous of retaining
his secret as were his female contemporaries, Lady Nairn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
and Lady Anne Barnard, to cast a veil over their poetical
character. The rapidity with which the "Great Unknown"
produced works of fiction, was one of the marvels
of the age; and many attempts were made to withdraw
the curtain which concealed the mysterious author.
Successive years produced at least one, and often two,
novels of a class infinitely superior to the romances of the
past age, all having reference to the manners and habits
of the most interesting and chivalrous periods of Scottish
or British history, which, in these works, were depicted
with a power and vivacity unattained by the most graphic
national historians. Subsequently to the publication
of "Guy Mannering" and "The Antiquary," in 1815
and 1816, and as an expedient to sustain the public interest,
Scott commenced a new series of novels, under
the title of "Tales of my Landlord," these being professedly
written by a different author; but this resort
was abandoned as altogether unnecessary for the contemplated
object. Each successive romance by the
author of "Waverley" awakened renewed ardour and
enthusiasm among the public, and commanded a circulation
commensurate with the bounds in which the language
was understood. Many of them were translated
into the various European languages. In the year 1814
he had published an edition of the works of Swift, in
nineteen volumes octavo.</p>

<p>For some years after his marriage, Scott had occupied
a cottage in the romantic vicinity of Lasswade, near
Edinburgh; but in 1804 he removed to Ashestiel, an old
mansion, beautifully situated on the banks of the Tweed,
seven miles above Selkirk, where, for several years, he
continued to reside during the vacation of the Court.
The ruling desire of his life was, that by the proceeds
of his intellectual labour he might acquire an ample<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
demesne, with a suitable mansion of his own, and thus
in some measure realise in his own person, and in those
of his representatives, somewhat of the territorial importance
of those olden barons, whose wassails and whose
feuds he had experienced delight in celebrating. To
attain such distinction as a Scottish <i>laird</i>, or landholder,
he was prepared to incur many sacrifices; nor was this
desire exceeded by regard for literary reputation. It was
unquestionably with a view towards the attainment of his
darling object, that he taxed so severely those faculties
with which nature had so liberally endowed him, and
exhibited a prolificness of authorship, such as has rarely
been evinced in the annals of literary history. In 1811
he purchased, on the south bank of the Tweed, near Melrose,
the first portion of that estate which, under the
name of Abbotsford, has become indelibly associated with
his history. The soil was then a barren waste, but by
extensive improvements the place speedily assumed the
aspect of amenity and beauty. The mansion, a curious
amalgamation, in questionable taste, of every species of
architecture, was partly built in 1811, and gradually
extended with the increasing emoluments of the owner.
By successive purchases of adjacent lands, the Abbotsford
property became likewise augmented, till the rental
amounted to about &pound;700 a-year&mdash;a return sufficiently
limited for an expenditure of upwards of &pound;50,000 on this
favourite spot.</p>

<p>At Abbotsford the poet maintained the character of a
wealthy country gentleman. He was visited by distinguished
persons from the sister kingdom, from the
Continent, and from America, all of whom he entertained
in a style of sumptuous elegance. Nor did his
constant social intercourse with his visitors and friends
interfere with the regular prosecution of his literary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
labours: he rose at six, and engaged in study and composition
till eleven o'clock. During the period of his
residence in the country, he devoted the remainder of
the day to his favourite exercise on horseback, the
superintendence of improvements on his property, and
the entertainment of his guests. In March 1820,
George IV., to whom he was personally known, and
who was a warm admirer of his genius, granted to him
the honour of a baronetcy, being the first which was
conferred by his Majesty after his accession. Prior to
this period, besides the works already enumerated, he
had given to the world his romances of "The Black
Dwarf," "Old Mortality," "Rob Roy," "The Heart of
Midlothian," "The Bride of Lammermoor," "A Legend
of Montrose," and "Ivanhoe." The attainment of the
baronetcy appears to have stimulated him to still
greater exertion. In 1820 he produced, besides "Ivanhoe,"
which appeared in the early part of that year,
"The Monastery" and "The Abbot;" and in the beginning
of 1821, the romance of "Kenilworth," being
twelve volumes published within the same number of
months. "The Pirate" and "The Fortunes of Nigel"
appeared in 1822; "Peveril of the Peak" and "Quentin
Durward," in 1823; "St Ronan's Well" and
"Redgauntlet," in 1824; and "The Tales of the Crusaders,"
in 1825.</p>

<p>During the visit of George IV. to Scotland, in 1822,
Sir Walter undertook the congenial duty of acting as
Master of Ceremonies, which he did to the entire satisfaction
of his sovereign and of the nation. But while
prosperity seemed to smile with increasing brilliancy,
adversity was hovering near. In 1826, Archibald Constable
and Company, the famous publishers of his
works, became insolvent, involving in their bankruptcy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
the printing firm of the Messrs Ballantyne, of which Sir
Walter was a partner. The liabilities amounted to the
vast sum of &pound;102,000, for which Sir Walter was individually
responsible. To a mind less balanced by
native intrepidity and fortified by principle, the apparent
wreck of his worldly hopes would have produced
irretrievable despondency; but Scott bore his misfortune
with magnanimity and manly resignation. He had
been largely indebted to both the establishments which
had unfortunately involved him in their fall, in the
elegant production of his works, as well as in respect of
pecuniary accommodation; and he felt bound in honour,
as well as by legal obligation, fully to discharge the
debt. He declined to accept an offer of the creditors to
be satisfied with a composition; and claiming only to be
allowed time, applied himself with indomitable energy
to his arduous undertaking, at the age of fifty-five,
in the full determination, if his life was spared, of cancelling
every farthing of his obligations. At the crisis
of his embarrassments he was engaged in the composition
of "Woodstock," which shortly afterwards
appeared. The "Life of Napoleon," which had for a
considerable time occupied his attention, was published
in 1827, in nine vols. octavo. In the course of its preparation
he had visited both London and Paris in
search of materials. In the same year he produced
"Chronicles of the Canongate," <i>first series</i>; and in the
year following, the second series of those charming
tales, and the first portion of his juvenile history of
Scotland, under the title of "Tales of a Grandfather."
A second portion of these tales appeared in 1829, and
the third and concluding series in 1830, when he also
contributed a graver History of Scotland in two
volumes to <i>Lardner's Cabinet Cyclop&aelig;dia</i>. In 1829<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
likewise appeared "Anne of Geierstein," a romance,
and in 1830 the "Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft."
In 1831 he produced a series of "Tales on French
History," uniform with the "Tales of a Grandfather," and
his novels, "Count Robert of Paris," and "Castle Dangerous,"
as a fourth series of "Tales of My Landlord."
Other productions of inferior mark appeared from his
pen; he contributed to the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, during
the first year of its career; wrote the articles, "Chivalry,"
"Romance," and "Drama," for the sixth edition of the
<i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>; and during his latter years contributed
somewhat copiously to the <i>Quarterly Review</i>.</p>

<p>At a public dinner in Edinburgh, for the benefit of
the Theatrical Fund, on the 23d of February 1827, Sir
Walter made his first avowal as to the authorship of the
Waverley Novels,&mdash;an announcement which scarcely
took the public by surprise. The physical energies of the
illustrious author were now suffering a rapid decline;
and in his increasing infirmities, and liability to sudden
and severe attacks of pain, and even of unconsciousness,
it became evident to his friends, that, in the praiseworthy
effort to pay his debts, he was sacrificing his health and
shortening his life. Those apprehensions proved not
without foundation. In the autumn of 1831, his health
became so lamentably broken, that his medical advisers
recommended a residence in Italy, and entire cessation
from mental occupation, as the only means of invigorating
a constitution so seriously dilapidated. But the
counsel came too late; the patient proceeded to Naples,
and afterwards to Rome, but experiencing no benefit
from the change, he was rapidly conveyed homewards in
the following summer, in obedience to his express wish,
that he might have the satisfaction of closing his eyes
at Abbotsford. The wish was gratified: he arrived at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
Abbotsford on the 11th of July 1832, and survived till
the 21st of the ensuing September. According to his
own request, his remains were interred in an aisle in
Dryburgh Abbey, which had belonged to one of his
ancestors, and had been granted to him by the late
Earl of Buchan. A heavy block of marble rests upon
the grave, in juxtaposition with another which has been
laid on that of his affectionate partner in life, who died
in May 1826. The aisle is protected by a heavy iron
railing.</p>

<p>In stature, Sir Walter Scott was above six feet; but
his personal appearance, which had otherwise been commanding,
was considerably marred by the lameness of
his right limb, which caused him to walk with an awkward
effort, and ultimately with much difficulty. His
countenance, so correctly represented in his numerous
portraits and busts, was remarkable for depth of forehead;
his features were somewhat heavy, and his eyes,
covered with thick eyelashes, were dull, unless animated
by congenial conversation. He was of a fair complexion;
and his hair, originally sandy, became gray
from a severe illness which he suffered in his 48th year.
His general conversation consisted in the detail of chivalric
adventures and anecdotes of the olden times. His
memory was so retentive that whatever he had studied
indelibly maintained a place in his recollection. In fertility
of imagination he surpassed all his contemporaries.
As a poet, if he has not the graceful elegance of
Campbell, and the fervid energy of Byron, he excels the
latter in purity of sentiment, and the former in vigour
of conception. His style was well adapted for the composition
of lyric poetry; but as he had no ear for music,
his song compositions are not numerous. Several of
these, however, have been set to music, and maintain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
their popularity.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> But Scott's reputation as a poet
is inferior to his reputation as a novelist; and
while even his best poems may cease to be generally
read, the author of the Waverley Novels will only be
forgotten with the disuse of the language. A cabinet
edition of these novels, with the author's last notes, and
illustrated with elegant engravings, appeared in forty-eight
volumes a short period before his decease; several
other complete editions have since been published by the
late Mr Robert Cadell, and by the present proprietors
of the copyright, the Messrs Black of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>As a man of amiable dispositions and incorruptible
integrity, Sir Walter Scott shone conspicuous among
his contemporaries, the latter quality being eminently
exhibited in his resolution to pay the whole of his heavy
pecuniary liabilities. To this effort he fell a martyr; yet
it was a source of consolation to his survivors, that, by
his own extraordinary exertions, the policy of life insurance
payable at his death, and the sum of &pound;30,000 paid
by Mr Cadell for the copyright of his works, the whole
amount of the debt was discharged. It is, however
painfully, to be remarked, that the object of his earlier
ambition, in raising a family, has not been realised. His
children, consisting of two sons and two daughters,
though not constitutionally delicate, have all departed
from the scene, and the only representative of his house
is the surviving child of his eldest daughter, who was
married to Mr John Gibson Lockhart, the late editor of
the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, and his literary executor. This
sole descendant, a grand-daughter, is the wife of Mr<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
Hope, Q.C., who has lately added to his patronymic the
name of Scott, and made Abbotsford his summer residence.
The memory of the illustrious Minstrel has
received every honour from his countrymen; monuments
have been raised to him in the principal towns&mdash;that in
the capital, a rich Gothic cross, being one of the noblest
decorations of his native city. Abbotsford has become the
resort of the tourist and of the traveller from every land,
who contemplate with interest and devotion a scene

<h2><a name="ROBERT_MACKAY_ROB_DONN" id="ROBERT_MACKAY_ROB_DONN"></a>ROBERT MACKAY (ROB DONN).</h2>


<p>Robert Mackay, called <i>Donn</i>, from the colour of his
hair, which was brown or chestnut, was born in the
Strathmore of Sutherlandshire, about the year 1714.</p>

<p>His calling, with the interval of a brief military service
in the fencibles, was the tending of cattle, in the
several gradations of herd, drover, and bo-man, or
responsible cow-keeper&mdash;the last, in his pastoral county,
a charge of trust and respectability. At one period
he had an appointment in Lord Reay's forest; but some
deviations into the "righteous theft"&mdash;so the Highlanders
of those parts, it seems, call the appropriation of
an occasional deer to their own use&mdash;forfeited his noble
employer's confidence. Rob, however, does not appear
to have suffered in his general character or reputation
for an <i>unconsidered trifle</i> like this, nor otherwise to have
declined in the favour of his chief, beyond the necessity
of transporting himself to a situation somewhat nearer
the verge of Cape Wrath than the bosom of the deer
preserve.</p>

<p>Mackay was happily married, and brought up a large
family in habits and sentiments of piety; a fact which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
his reverend biographer connects very touchingly with
the stated solemnities of the "Saturday night," when
the lighter chants of the week were exchanged at the
worthy drover's fireside for the purer and holier melodies
of another inspiration.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> As a pendant to this
creditable account of the bard's principles, we are informed
that he was a frequent guest at the presbytery
dinner-table; a circumstance which some may be so
malicious as to surmise amounted to nothing more than
a purpose to enhance the festive recreations of the reverend
body&mdash;a suspicion, we believe, in this particular
instance, totally unfounded. He died in 1778; and
he has succeeded to some rather peculiar honours for
a person in his position, or even of his mark. He has
had a reverend doctor for his editorial biographer,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and
no less than Sir Walter Scott for his reviewer.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>The passages which Sir Walter has culled from
some literal translations that were submitted to him,
are certainly the most favourable specimens of the bard
that we have been able to discover in his volume. The
rest are generally either satiric rants too rough or too
local for transfusion, or panegyrics on the living and the
dead, in the usual extravagant style of such compositions,
according to the taste of the Highlanders and the
usage of their bards; or they are love-lays, of which the
language is more copious and diversified than the sentiment.
In the gleanings on which we have ventured,
after the illustrious person who has done so much
honour to the bard by his comments and selections, we
have attempted to draw out a little more of the peculiar
character of the poet's genius.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="THE_SONG_OF_WINTER" id="THE_SONG_OF_WINTER"></a>THE SONG OF WINTER.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is selected as a specimen of Mackay's descriptive poetry.
It is in a style peculiar to the Highlands, where description
runs so entirely into epithets and adjectives, as to render recitation
breathless, and translation hopeless. Here, while we have
retained the imagery, we have been unable to find room, or rather
rhyme, for one half of the epithets in the original. The power of
alliterative harmony in the original song is extraordinary.</p></div>

<p>During a long absence on a droving expedition, Mackay was
deprived of his mistress by another lover, whom, in fine, she married.
The discovery he made, on his return, led to this compo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>sition;
which is a sequel to another composed on his distant
journey, in which he seems to prognosticate something like what
happened. Both are selected by Sir Walter Scott as specimens
of the bard, and may be found paraphrastically rendered in a
prose version, in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, vol. xlv., p. 371, and in the
notes to the last edition of "The Highland Drover," in "Chronicles
of the Canongate." With regard to the present specimen, it may
be remarked, that part of the original is either so obscure, or so
freely rendered by Sir Walter Scott's translator, that we have
attempted the present version, not without some little perplexity
as to the sense of one or two allusions. We claim, on the whole,
the merit of almost literal fidelity.</p>

<h4>TO A PIOBRACH TUNE.</h4>

<p>This is one of those lyrics, of which there are many in Gaelic
poetry, that are intended to imitate pipe music. They consist of
three parts, called Urlar, Siubhal, and Crunluath. The first is a
slow, monotonous measure, usually, indeed, a mere repetition of
the same words or tones; the second, a livelier or brisker melody,
striking into description or narrative; the third, a rapid finale,
taxing the reciter's or performer's powers to their utmost pitch
of expedition. The heroine of the song is the same Isabel who is
introduced towards the commencement of the "Forsaken Drover;"
and it appears, from other verses in Mackay's collection, that it
was not her fate to be "alone" through life. It is to be understood
that when the verses were composed, she was in charge of
her father's extensive pastoral <i>man&eacute;ge</i>, and not a mere milk-maid
or dairy-woman.</p>

<h2><a name="DOUGAL_BUCHANAN" id="DOUGAL_BUCHANAN"></a>DOUGAL BUCHANAN.</h2>


<p>Dougal Buchanan was born at the Mill of Ardoch, in
the beautiful valley of Strathyre, and parish of Balquhidder,
in the year 1716. His parents were in circumstances
to allow him the education of the parish school;
on which, by private application, he so far improved, as
to be qualified to act as teacher and catechist to the
Highland locality which borders on Loch Rannoch,
under the appointment of the Society for Propagating
Christian Knowledge. Never, it is believed, were the
duties of a calling discharged with more zeal and efficiency.
The catechist was, both in and out of the strict
department of his office, a universal oracle,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> and his
name is revered in the scene of his usefulness in a degree
to which the honours of canonization could scarcely
have added. Pious, to the height of a proverbial model,
he was withal frank, cheerful, and social; and from his
extraordinary command of the Gaelic idiom, and its
poetic phraseology, he must have lent an ear to many a
song and many a legend<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>&mdash;a nourishment of the imagination
in which, as well as in purity of Gaelic, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
native Balquhidder was immeasurably inferior to the
Rannoch district of his adoption.</p>

<p>The composition of hymns, embracing a most eloquent
and musical paraphrase of many of the more striking
inspirations of scriptural poetry, seems to have been the
favourite employment of his leisure hours. These are
sung or recited in every cottage of the Highlands where
a reader or a retentive memory is to be found.</p>

<p>Buchanan's life was short. He was cut off by typhus
fever, at a period when his talents had begun to attract
a more than local attention. It was within a year after
his return from superintending the press of the first version
of the Gaelic New Testament, that his lamented
death took place. His command of his native tongue
is understood to have been serviceable to the translator,
the Rev. James Stewart of Killin, who had probably
been Buchanan's early acquaintance, as they were
natives of the same district. This reverend gentleman
is said to have entertained a scheme of getting the catechist
regularly licensed to preach the gospel without
the usual academical preparation. The scheme was frustrated
by his death, in the summer of 1768.</p>

<p>We know of no fact relating to the development of
the poetic vein of this interesting bard, unless it be found
in the circumstance to which he refers in his "Diary,"<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
of having been bred a violent Jacobite, and having lived
many years under the excitement of strong, even vindictive
feelings, at the fate of his chief and landlord (Buchanan
of Arnprior and Strathyre), who, with many of his
dependents, and some of the poet's relations, suffered
death for their share in the last rebellion. While he
relates that the power of religion at length quenched this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
effervescence of his emotions, it may be supposed that
ardent Jacobitism, with its common accompaniment of
melody, may have fostered an imagination which every
circumstance proves to have been sufficiently susceptible.
It may be added, as a particular not unworthy of
memorial in a poet's life, that his remains are deposited
in perhaps the most picturesque place of sepulture in the
kingdom&mdash;the peninsula of Little Leny, in the neighbourhood
of Callander; to which his relatives transferred
his body, as the sepulchre of many chiefs and considerable
persons of his clan, and where it is perhaps matter
of surprise that his Highland countrymen have never
thought of honouring his memory with some kind of
monument.</p>

<p>The poetic remains of Dougal Buchanan do not afford
extensive materials for translation. The subjects with
which he deals are too solemn, and their treatment too
surcharged with scriptural imagery, to be available for
the purposes of a popular collection, of which the object
is not directly religious. The only exception that
occurs, perhaps, is his poem on "The Skull." Even
in this case some moral pictures<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> have been omitted, as
either too coarsely or too solemnly touched, to be fit for
our purpose. A few lines of the conclusion are also
omitted, as being mere amplifications of Scripture&mdash;wonderful,
indeed, in point of vernacular beauty or
sublimity, but not fusible for other use. Slight traces
of imitation may be perceived; "The Grave" of Blair,
and some passages of "Hamlet," being the apparent
models.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="DUNCAN_MACINTYRE" id="DUNCAN_MACINTYRE"></a>DUNCAN MACINTYRE.</h2>


<p>Duncan Macintyre (Donacha Ban) is considered by
his countrymen the most extraordinary genius that
the Highlands in modern times have produced. Without
having learned a letter of any alphabet, he was enabled
to pour forth melodies that charmed every ear to
which they were intelligible. And he is understood to
have had the published specimens of his poetry committed
to writing by no mean judge of their merit,&mdash;the
late Dr Stewart of Luss,&mdash;who, when a young man, became
acquainted with this extraordinary person, in consequence
of his being employed as a kind of under-keeper
in a forest adjoining to the parish of which
the Doctor's father was minister.</p>

<p>Macintyre was born in Druimliart of Glenorchy on
the 20th of March 1724, and died in October 1812.
He was chiefly employed in the capacity of keeper
in several of the Earl of Breadalbane's forests. He
carried a musket, however, in his lordship's fencibles;
which led him to take part, much against his inclination,
in the Whig ranks at the battle of Falkirk. Later in life
he transferred his musket to the Edinburgh City Guard.</p>

<p>Macintyre's best compositions are those which are
descriptive of forest scenes, and those which he dedicated
to the praise of his wife. His verses are, however, very
numerous, and embrace a vast variety of subjects. From
the extraordinary diffusiveness of his descriptions, and
the boundless luxuriance of his expressions, much difficulty
has been experienced in reproducing his strains in
the English idiom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

fastnesses, than of the habits of the creatures that tenant the
locality&mdash;the dun-deer, and the roe. So minutely enthusiastic
is the hunter's treatment of his theme, that the attempt to
win any favour for his performance from the Saxon reader, is
attended with no small risk,&mdash;although it is possible that a little
practice with the rifle in any similar wilderness may propitiate
even the holiday sportsman somewhat in favour of the subject
and its minute details. We must commit this forest minstrel to
the good-nature of other readers, entreating them only to render<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
due acknowledgment to the forbearance which has, in the meantime,
troubled them only with the first half of the performance,
and with a single stanza of the finale. The composition is always
rehearsed or sung to pipe music, of which it is considered, by
those who understand the original, a most extraordinary echo,
besides being in other respects a very powerful specimen of Gaelic
minstrelsy.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Macintyre acted latterly as a constable of the City Guard of
Edinburgh, a situation procured him by the Earl of Breadalbane,
at his own special request; that benevolent nobleman having
inquired of the bard what he could do for him to render him
independent in his now advanced years. His salary as a peace-officer
was sixpence a-day; but the poet was so abundantly satisfied
with the attainment of his position and endowments, that he
gave expression to his feelings of satisfaction in a piece of
minstrelsy, which in the original ranks among his best productions.
Of this ode we are enabled to present a faithful
metrical translation, quite in the spirit of the original, as far as
conversion of the Gaelic into the Scottish idiom is practicable.
The version was kindly undertaken at our request by Mr
William Sinclair, the ingenious author of "Poems of the Fancy
and the Affections," who has appropriately adapted it to the lively
tune, "Alister M'Alister." The song, remarks Mr Sinclair, is
much in the spirit, though in a more humorous strain, of the
famous Sword Song, beginning in the translation, "Come forth,
my glittering Bride," composed by Theodore K&ouml;rner of Dresden,
and the last and most remarkable of his patriotic productions,
wherein the soldier addresses his sword as his bride, thereby
giving expression to the most glowing sentiments of patriotism.
Macintyre addresses as his wife the musket which he carried as
an officer of the guard; and is certainly as enthusiastic in praise
of his new acquisition, as ever was love-sick swain in eulogy of
the most attractive fair one.</p></div>

<h2><a name="JOHN_MACODRUM" id="JOHN_MACODRUM"></a>JOHN MACODRUM.</h2>


<p>Jan Macodrum, the Bard of Uist, was patronised by
an eminent judge of merit, Sir James Macdonald of Skye,&mdash;of
whom, after a distinguished career at Oxford, such
expectations were formed, that on his premature death
at Rome he was lamented as the Marcellus of Scotland.</p>

<p>Macodrum's name is cited in the Ossianic controversy,
upon Sir James's report, as a person whose mind was
stored with Ossianic poetry, of which Macpherson
gave to the world the far-famed specimens. A humorous
story is told of Macodrum (who was a noted humorist)
having trifled a little with the translator when he
applied for a sample of the old Fingalian, in the words,
"Hast thou got anything of, or on, (equivalent in Gaelic
to <i>hast thou anything to get of</i>) the Fingalian heroes?"
"If I have," quoth Macodrum, "I fear it is now irrecoverable."</p>

<p>Macodrum, whose real patronymic is understood to
have been Macdonald, lived to lament his patron in
elegiac strains&mdash;a fact that brings the time in which he
flourished down to 1766.</p>

<p>His poem entitled the "Song of Age," is admired
by his countrymen for its rapid succession of images (a
little too mixed or abrupt on some occasions), its descriptive
power, and its neatness and flow of versification.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p>The picturesque portion of the description here terminates.
With respect to the moral and religious application, it is but just
to the poet to say, that before the close he appeals in pathetic
terms to the young, warning them not to boast of their strength,
or to abuse it; and that he concludes his lay with the sentiment,
that whatever may be the ills of "age," there are worse that await
an unrepenting death, and a suffering eternity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>

<span class="smcap" style="font-size: 75%;">Or, Tormaid Ban.</span></h2>


<p>Single-speech Hamilton may be said to have had his
<i>marrow</i> in a Highland bard, nearly his contemporary,
whose one effort was attended with more lasting popularity
than the sole oration of that celebrated person.
The clan song of the Mackenzies is the composition in
question, and its author is now ascertained to have been
a gentleman, or farmer of the better class, of the name
of Norman Macleod, a native of Assynt<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> in Sutherland.
The most memorable particular known of this person,
besides the production of his poetic effort, is his having
been the father of a Glasgow professor,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> whom we remember
occupying the chair of Church History in the
university in very advanced age, about 1814, assisted
by a helper and successor; and of another son, who was
the respected minister of Rogart till towards the end of
last century.</p>

<p>The date of "Caberfae" is not exactly ascertained.
It was composed during the exile of Lord Seaforth, but,
we imagine, before the '45, in which he did not take
part, and while Macshimei (Lord Lovat) still passed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
for a Whig. In Mackenzie's excellent collection (p.
361), a later date is assigned to the production.</p>

<p>The Seaforth tenantry, who (after the manner of the
clans) privately supported their chief in his exile, appear
to have been much aggrieved by some proceedings of
the loyalist, Monro of Fowlis, who, along with his
neighbour of Culloden and Lovat, were probably acting
under government commission, in which the interests of
the crown were seconded by personal or family antagonism.
The loyal family of Sutherland, who seem by
grant or lease to have had an interest in the estates,
also come in for a share of the bard's resentment.</p>

<p>All this forms the subject of "Caberfae," which,
without having much meaning or poetry, served, like
the celebrated "Lillibulero," to animate armies, and
inflame party spirit to a degree that can scarcely be
imagined. The repetition of "the Staghead, when
rises his cabar on," which concludes every strophe, is
enough at any time to bring a Mackenzie to his feet, or
into the forefront of battle,&mdash;being a simple allusion to
the Mackenzie crest, allegorised into an emblem of the
stag at bay, or ready in his ire to push at his assailant.
The cabar is the horn, or, rather, the "tine of the first-head,"&mdash;no
ignoble emblem, certainly, of clannish fury
and impetuosity. The difficulty of the measure compels
us to the use of certain metrical freedoms, and also of
some Gaelic words, for which is craved the reader's
indulgence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Of the "Flowers of the Forest," two other versions appear in the Collections.
That version beginning, "I've heard the lilting at our yow-milking,"
is the composition of Miss Jane Elliot, the daughter of Sir Gilbert
Elliot of Minto, Lord Justice-Clerk, who died in 1766. She composed the
song about the middle of the century, in imitation of an old version to the
same tune. The other version, which is the most popular of the three, with
the opening line, "I 've seen the smiling of fortune beguiling," was also the
composition of a lady, Miss Alison Rutherford; by marriage, Mrs Cockburn,
wife of Mr Patrick Cockburn, advocate. Mrs Cockburn was a person of
highly superior accomplishments. She associated with her learned contemporaries,
by whom she was much esteemed, and died at Edinburgh in 1794,
at an advanced age. "The forest" mentioned in the song comprehended
the county of Selkirk, with portions of Peeblesshire and Lanarkshire. This
was a hunting-forest of the Scottish kings.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> These lines were addressed by Mrs Hunter to her daughter, on the
occasion of her marriage.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> These verses form a modernised version of the old and popular song,
"Will ye gae to the ewe-bughts, Marion?" The air is extremely beautiful.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> We quote from an autobiography of the poet, the original of which is in
the possession of one of his surviving friends. We have likewise to acknowledge
our obligations to Dr Muschet, of Birkhill, near Stirling, for communicating
some interesting letters of Macneill, addressed to his late father.
The late Mr John Campbell, Writer to the Signet, had undertaken to supply
a memoir for this work, partly from his own recollections of his deceased
friend; but, before he could fulfil his promise, he was called to rest with
his fathers. We have, however, taken advantage of his reminiscences of
the bard, orally communicated to us. An intelligent abridgment of the
autobiography appears in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, vol. iv. p. 273. See
likewise the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>, vol. xv. p. 307.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> This song was first published, in May 1791, in <i>The Bee</i>, an Edinburgh
periodical, conducted by Dr James Anderson.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> This beautiful ballad was first printed, in 1791, in <i>The Bee</i>. It is
adapted to an old and sweet air, to which, however, very puerile words were
attached.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Mr Graham, of Gartmore, an intimate friend of Hector Macneill, composed
a song, having a similar burden, the chorus proceeding thus:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then, tell me how to woo thee, love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, tell me how to woo thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thy dear sake nae care I'll take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though ne'er another trow me."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
This was published by Sir Walter Scott, in the "Minstrelsy of the Scottish
Border," as a production of the reign of Charles I.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> The first stanza of this song, along with a second, which is unsuitable
for insertion, has been ascribed, on the authority of Burns, to the Rev.
John Clunie, minister of Borthwick, in Mid-Lothian, who died in 1819,
aged sixty-two. Ritson, however, by prefixing the letters "J. D." to the
original stanza would seem to point to a different author.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> This fine ballad was written by Macneill, to commemorate the death of
his friend, Captain Stewart, a brave officer, betrothed to a young lady in
Athole, who, in 1777, fell at the battle of Saratoga, in America. The words,
which are adapted to an old Gaelic air, appear with music in Smith's
"Scottish Minstrel," vol. iii. p. 28. The ballad, in the form given above,
has been improved in several of the stanzas by the author, on his original version,
published in Johnson's "Museum." See the "Museum," vol. iv. p. 238.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> Mora is the name of a small valley in Athole, so designated by the
two lovers.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> This song was originally printed on a single sheet, by N. Stewart and
Co., Edinburgh, in 1794, as the lament of a lady on the death of an officer. It
does not appear in Macneill's "Poetical Works," but he asserted to Mr Stenhouse
his claims to the authorship.&mdash;Johnson's "Museum," vol. iv. p. 323.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> The last verse of this song was added by John Hamilton. The song,
on account of this addition, was not included by Macneill in the collected
edition of his "Poetical Works." One of Miss Blamire's songs has the same
opening line; and it has been conjectured by Mr Maxwell, the editor of her
poems, that Macneill had been indebted to her song for suggesting his

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> This song originally consisted of two stanzas, the third stanza being
subsequently added by the author. It is adapted to a beautiful old air,
"Logan Water," incongruously connected with some indecorous stanzas.
Burns deemed Mayne's version an elder production of the Scottish muse, and
attempted to modernise the song, but his edition is decidedly inferior. Other
four stanzas have been added, by some anonymous versifier, to Mayne's
verses, which first appeared in Duncan's "Encyclop&aelig;dia of Scottish, English,
and Irish Songs," printed at Glasgow in 1836, 2 vols. 12mo. In those
stanzas the lover is brought back to Logan braes, and consummates his
union with his weeping shepherdess. The stream of Logan takes its rise
among the hills separating the parishes of Lesmahago and Muirkirk, and,
after a flow of eight miles, deposits its waters into the Nethan river.</p></div>

attractions and numerous accomplishments, named Helen Irving, daughter
of Irving of Kirkconnel, in Annandale, was betrothed to Adam Fleming de
Kirkpatrick, a young gentleman of fortune in the neighbourhood. Walking
with her lover on the banks of the Kirtle, she was slain by a shot which had
been aimed at Fleming by a disappointed rival. The melancholy history has
been made the theme of three different ballads, two of these being old.
The present ballad, by Mr Mayne, was inserted by Sir Walter Scott in the
Edinburgh <i>Annual Register</i> of 1815.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> Burns composed two verses to the same tune, which is very old. It was
a favourite of Queen Mary, the consort of William III. In his "Beggar's
Opera," Gay has adopted the tune for one of his songs. It was published,
in 1652, by John Hilton, as the third voice to what is called a
"Northern Catch" for three voices, beginning&mdash;"I'se gae wi' thee, my sweet
Peggy."</p></div>

of this song. It was originally published at Paisley, in 1790, to the tune of
"One bottle more." Auchtertool is a small hamlet in Fifeshire, about five
miles west of the town of Kirkcaldy. The inhabitants, whatever may have
been their failings at the period when Wilson in vain solicited shelter in the
hamlet, are certainly no longer entitled to bear the reproach of lacking in
hospitality. We rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of testifying as to
the disinterested hospitality and kindness which we have experienced in that
neighbourhood.</p></div>

thus remarks&mdash;"I sometimes say to myself, 'This is no me,' so greatly have

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_46_46" id="Footnote_46_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_46"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> A daughter of Baron Hume was one of the ladies who induced Lady
Nairn to become a contributor to "The Scottish Minstrel." Many of the
songs were sent to the Editor through the medium of Miss Hume. She thus
expresses herself in a letter to a friend:&mdash;"My father's admiration of 'The
Land o' the Leal' was such, that he said no woman but Miss Ferrier was
capable of writing it. And when I used to shew him song after song in
MS., when I was receiving the anonymous verses for the music, and ask his
criticism, he said&mdash;'Your unknown poetess has only <i>one</i>, or rather <i>two</i>, letters
out of taste, viz., choosing "B. B." for her signature.'"</p></div>

indebted, in addition to its intrinsic merits, to the musical powers of the late
John Wilson, the eminent vocalist, whose premature death is a source of
regret to all lovers of Scottish melody. Mr Wilson sung this song in every
principal town of the United Kingdom, and always with effect.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_49_49" id="Footnote_49_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> This exquisitely tender and beautiful lay was composed by Lady Nairn,
for two married relatives of her own, Mr and Mrs C&mdash;&mdash;, who had sustained
bereavement in the death of a child. Such is the account of its origin which
we have received from Lady Nairn's relatives.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_50_50" id="Footnote_50_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50_50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> This humorous and highly popular song was composed by Lady Nairn
towards the close of the last century, in place of the older words connected
with the air, "When she came ben, she bobbit." The older version, which
is entitled "Cockpen," is exceptional on the score of refinement, but was formerly
sung on account of the excellence of the air. It is generally believed
to be a composition of the reign of Charles II.; and the hero of the piece,
"the Laird of Cockpen," is said to have been the companion in arms and
attached friend of his sovereign. Of this personage an anecdote is recorded
in some of the Collections. Having been engaged with his countrymen at
the battle of Worcester, in the cause of Charles, he accompanied the unfortunate
monarch to Holland, and, forming one of the little court at the
Hague, amused his royal master by his humour, and especially by his skill
in Scottish music. In playing the tune, "Brose and Butter," he particularly
excelled; it became the favourite of the exiled monarch, and Cockpen
had pleasure in gratifying the royal wish, that he might be lulled to sleep at
night, and awakened in the morning by this enchanting air. At the Restoration,
Cockpen found that his estate had been confiscated for his attachment to
the king, and had the deep mortification to discover that he had suffered on behalf
of an ungrateful prince, who gave no response to his many petitions and
entreaties for the restoration of his possessions. Visiting London, he was
even denied an audience; but he still entertained a hope that, by a personal
conference with the king, he might attain his object. To accomplish this
design, he had recourse to the following artifice:&mdash;He formed acquaintance
with the organist of the chapel-royal, and obtained permission to officiate as
his substitute when the king came to service. He did so with becoming
propriety till the close of the service, when, instead of the solemn departing
air, he struck up the monarch's old favourite, "Brose and Butter." The
scheme, though bordering on profanity, succeeded in the manner intended.
The king proceeding hastily to the organ-gallery, discovered Cockpen, whom
he saluted familiarly, declaring that he had "almost made him dance."
"I could dance too," said Cockpen, "if I had my lands again." The request,
to which every entreaty could not gain a response, was yielded to the
power of music and old association. Cockpen was restored to his inheritance.
The modern ballad has been often attributed to Miss Ferrier, the accomplished
author of "Marriage," and other popular novels. She only contributed
the last two stanzas. The present Laird of Cockpen is the Marquis of
Dalhousie.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_51_51" id="Footnote_51_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> The first two lines of this song are borrowed from the "Lea-Rig," a
lively and popular lyric, of which the first two verses were composed by Robert
Fergusson, the three remaining being added by William Reid of Glasgow.
(See <i><a href="#WILLIAM_REID">ante</a></i>, article "<a href="#WILLIAM_REID">William Reid</a>.")</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_52_52" id="Footnote_52_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> The author seems to have composed these stanzas as a sequel to a wooing
song of the same name, beginning, "Robin is my only jo," which first
appeared in Herd's Collection in 1776. There are some older words to the
same air, but these are coarse, and are not to be found in any of the modern
Collections.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_53_53" id="Footnote_53_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> Another song with the same title, "Saw ye nae my Peggy?" is inserted
in the Collections. It first appeared in Herd's Collection, in 1769, though
it is understood to be of a considerably older date. Allan Ramsay composed
two songs to the same air, but they are both inferior. The air is believed
to have originally been connected with some exceptionable words, beginning,
"Saw ye my Maggie?"</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54_54" id="Footnote_54_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> This excellent ballad is the fourth version adapted to the air, "Cauld

<a href="#Page_46">p. 46</a>.</p></div>


<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_55_55" id="Footnote_55_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_55"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> There are several other versions of this highly popular song. One of
these, the composition of William Reid of Glasgow, has already been adduced.
See <i><a href="#KATE_O_GOWRIE37">ante</a></i>, <a href="#Page_157">p. 157</a>. Another, which is one of the most celebrated,
in the first two verses is nearly the same with the opening stanzas of Lady
Nairn's version, the sequel proceeding as follows:&mdash;

noble family of Argyll, from the middle of the fifteenth till the middle of the
seventeenth century, when it was burnt by the Marquis of Montrose&mdash;an
enterprise to which he was excited by the Ogilvies, who thus sought revenge
for the destruction, by the Marquis of Argyll, of the "bonnie house of
Airlie." The castle is situated on a promontory of the Ochil hills, near the
village of Dollar, in Clackmannanshire, and has long been in the ruinous
condition described in the song. Two hill rivulets, designated <i>Sorrow</i> and
<i>Care</i>, proceed on either side of the castle promontory. John Knox, the Reformer,
for some time resided in Castle Gloom, with Archibald, fourth Earl
of Argyll, and here preached the Reformed doctrines.</p></div>

Police Acts came into operation, was composed principally of Highlandmen,
some of them old pensioners. Their rendezvous, or place of resort, was
in the vicinity of old St Giles's Church, where they might generally be
found smoking, snuffing, and speaking in the true Highland vernacular.
Archie Campbell, celebrated by Macintyre as "Captain Campbell," was
the last, and a favourable specimen of this class of civic functionaries. He
was a stout, tall man; and, dressed in his "knee breeks and buckles, wi' the
red-necked coat, and the cocked hat," he considered himself of no ordinary
importance. He had a most thorough contempt for grammar, and looked
upon the Lord Provost as the greatest functionary in the world. He
delighted to be called "the Provost's right-hand man." Archie is still well
remembered by many of the inhabitants of Edinburgh, as he was quite a
character in the city. In dealing with a prisoner, Archie used to impress
him with the idea that he could do great things for him by merely speaking
to "his honour the Provost;" and when locking a prisoner up in the
Tolbooth, he would say sometimes&mdash;"There, my lad, I cannot do nothing
more for you!" He took care to give his friends from the Highlands a
magnificent notion of his great personal consequence, which, of course, they
aggrandised when they returned to the hills.</p></div>
